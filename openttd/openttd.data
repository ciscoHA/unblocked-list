# Contributing to OpenTTD

Looking to contribute something to OpenTTD? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for help playing or using OpenTTD.
Please try [irc](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/IRC%20channel), [Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd), or the [forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/)

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead.
We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

* Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding add-on content in NewGRF, GameScripts, AIs, etc.
These are created by third-parties.  Please try [irc](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/IRC%20channel), [Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd), or the [forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/) to discuss these.

* Please use [the web translator](https://translator.openttd.org/) to submit corrections and improvements to translations of the game.


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. Please don't report issues with games where you changed NewGRFs mid-game. (This can be verified with the `gamelog` console command in-game.)

1. Please don't report issues with modified versions of OpenTTD (patchpacks, unofficial ports, and similar).

2. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been
reported.

3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `nightly` build of OpenTTD, available from https://www.openttd.org

4. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create reproducible steps with an attached savegame and screenshots. Try to use few or no NewGRFs, AIs etc if possible.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

* What is your environment?
* What steps will reproduce the issue?
* Which operating system(s) experience the problem?
* What would you expect to be the outcome?

All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Attached savegame
> Attached screenshots showing the issue
> Crashlogs if the bug causes a crash
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the [scope and goals](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-goals) of the project.

It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

Please provide as much detail and context as possible.
This means don't request for a solution, but describe the problem you see and how/why you think it should be fixed.

For feature request we have a strict policy.

Keeping issues around with "a good idea" or "not really a bug but we should maybe fix it" turns out to have the reversed effect: nobody looks at it anymore.

Although we really appreciate feedback and ideas, we will close feature requests that we don't expect to fulfill in the next year.

Many of those ideas etc do have a place on the [forums](https://www.tt-forums.net); and if enough people like it, someone will stand up and make it.

It's usually best to discuss on [Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd) before opening a feature request or working on a large feature in a fork.
Discussion can take time, but it can be productive and avoid disappointment. :)


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help.

Pull requests should fit with the [goals of the project](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-goals).

**Please do ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Every pull request should have a clear scope, with no unrelated commits.

[Code style](./CODINGSTYLE.md) must be complied with for pull requests to be accepted; this also includes [commit message format](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OpenTTD.git openttd
git clone https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD-git-hooks.git openttd_hooks
cd openttd
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD.git
cd .git/hooks
ln -s ../../../openttd_hooks/hooks/* .
```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
contain your feature, change, or fix:

```bash
git checkout upstream/master -b <topic-branch-name>
```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message) or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project.
Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally rebase the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork the first time:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <topic-branch-name>
```

And any time after that:

```bash
git push
```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description against the `master` branch.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a pull request or patch, you agree to the [License](#license) and the [Privacy Notice](CONTRIBUTING.md#privacy-notice).


### Pull request validation

Continuous integration (CI) tools monitor pull requests, and help us identify build and code quality issues.

The results of the CI tests will show on your pull request.

By clicking on Details you can further zoom in; in case of a failure it will show you why it failed.
In case of success it will report how awesome you were.

Tip: [commit message format](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message) is a common reason for pull requests to fail validation.


### Are there any development docs?

There is no single source for OpenTTD development docs. It's a complex project with a long history, and multiple APIs.

A good entry point is [Development](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/) on the OpenTTD wiki; this provides links to wiki documentation and other sources.

The GitHub repo also includes some non-comprehensive documentation in [/docs](./docs).
These include:
- When to [change other languages and when not to](./docs/eints.md).
- The [savegame format](./docs/savegame_format.md).
- The [release process](./docs/releasing_openttd.md).
- Some [notes on the link graph algorithm](./docs/linkgraph.md).
- The [network game coordinator](./docs/game_coordinator.md).
- How to use [the admin port for network games](./docs/admin_network.md), also useful for multiplayer server hosts.
- The [performance metrics and logging features](./docs/logging_and_performance_metrics.md), also useful for add-on developers.
- How [symbol server and analysis works](./docs/symbol_server.md).
- And several miscellaneous files detailing internal data structures and graphics measurements and palettes.

You may also want the guide to [compiling OpenTTD](./COMPILING.md).


## Project goals

### What are the goals of the official branch?

The main goals of the official branch are:

- Stay faithful to the original gameplay from Transport Tycoon Deluxe
- Improve the user interface
- Allow extending the gameplay with add-ons / mods via supported content APIs
- Provide a (relatively) stable core for both players of the official branch, and for authors of add-ons and maintainers of patchpacks

In contrast, extending or altering the gameplay of the base game is not encouraged.

The rationale behind these goals is that people have different opinions about what OpenTTD is and what it should be.
When it comes to gameplay, there are at least these groups of people:

- *Model railway (mostly singleplayer)*: build "realistic" landscapes, roleplay a world, or even replicate historical scenarios
- *Economical challenge (mostly singleplayer)*: run a business with economical challenges
- *Transport challenge (singleplayer or cooperative multiplayer)*: build efficient track layouts with high cargo throughput and tons of vehicles
- *Competitive speed run (competitive multiplayer)*: maximize some goal in some limited amount of time

When it comes to gameplay features there are at least these groups of interests:

- *Control freak:* micromanagement like conditional orders, refitting and loading etc.
- *Casual:* automatisation like cargodist, path based signalling etc.

To please everyone, the official branch tries to stay close to the original gameplay; after all, that is what brought everyone here.
The preferred method to alter and extend the gameplay is via add-ons like NewGRF and GameScripts.

For a long time, the official branch was also open to features which could be enabled/disabled, but the corner-cases that came with some configurations have rendered some parts of the code very complicated.
Today, new features have to work with all the already existing features, which is not only challenging in corner cases, but also requires spending considerable more work than just "making it work in the game mode that I play".

The preferred method to introduce new gameplay features is to extend the content APIs, supporting ever more add-on content / mods.

This moves conflict-solving away from the codebase to content authors / players.
It is more accepted for add-ons not working together than the base game not working with certain setting combinations.

In general the game should allow anything that doesn't violate basic rules, but it should warn players if they take potentially dangerous or "stupid" actions.

For example, players are not prevented from starting vehicles without orders, but will receive a warning about vehicles having too few orders.
This lack of limitation has led to players challenging themselves to create networks where all vehicles have no orders, increasing gameplay possibilities.

### I do not agree with the goals of the official branch, what can I do instead?

Fork!  There is a rich history of experimental patches for OpenTTD.

Many of these will never be accepted for core, but are creative and interesting ways to modify OpenTTD.

Sometimes patches are combined into long-running patchpacks, modified OpenTTD versions which can be downloaded by anyone, or modified OpenTTD clients for dedicated multiplayer servers.

One of the reasons to keep core relatively stable is to make life easier for patch authors and patchpack maintainers where possible.

Patchpack discussions and related topics may be found in community sites such as [TT-Forums development section](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33).


## Legal stuff

### License

By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the [GPL v2](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/COPYING.md).


### Privacy Notice

We would like to make you aware that contributing to OpenTTD via git will permanently store the name and email address you provide as well as the actual changes and the time and date you made it inside git's version history.

This is inevitable, because it is a main feature of git.
If you are concerned about your privacy, we strongly recommend to use "Anonymous &lt;anonymous@openttd.org&gt;" as the git commit author. We might refuse anonymous contributions if malicious intent is suspected.

Please note that the contributor identity, once given, is used for copyright verification and to provide proof should a malicious commit be made.
As such, the [EU GDPR](https://gdpr.eu) "right to be forgotten" does not apply, as this is an overriding legitimate interest.

Please also note that your commit is public and as such will potentially be processed by many third-parties.
Git's distributed nature makes it impossible to track where exactly your commit, and thus your personal data, will be stored and be processed.
If you would not like to accept this risk, please do either commit anonymously or refrain from contributing to the OpenTTD project.

GNU General Public License
==========================

_Version 2, June 1991_
_Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,_
_51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA_

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** copyright the software, and
**(2)** offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

**0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

* **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
* **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
* **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

**3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

* **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
* **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
* **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

**4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

**5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

**6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

**7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

**8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

**9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

**10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

### NO WARRANTY

**11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**12.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w` and `show c` should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w` and `show c`; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

## 1.0) About

OpenTTD is a transport simulation game based upon the popular game Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written by Chris Sawyer.
It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.

OpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0, but includes some 3rd party software under different licenses.
See the section ["Licensing"](#30-licensing) below for details.

## 1.1) Downloading OpenTTD

OpenTTD can be downloaded from the [official OpenTTD website](https://www.openttd.org/).

Both 'stable' and 'nightly' versions are available for download:

- most people should choose the 'stable' version, as this has been more extensively tested
- the 'nightly' version includes the latest changes and features, but may sometimes be less reliable

OpenTTD is also available for free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536610/OpenTTD/), [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/openttd), and the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/openttd-official/9ncjg5rvrr1c). On some platforms OpenTTD will be available via your OS package manager or a similar service.


## 1.2) OpenTTD gameplay manual

OpenTTD has a [community-maintained wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/), including a gameplay manual and tips.


## 1.3) Supported platforms

OpenTTD has been ported to several platforms and operating systems.

The currently supported platforms are:

- Linux (SDL (OpenGL and non-OpenGL))
- macOS (universal) (Cocoa)
- Windows (Win32 GDI / OpenGL)

Other platforms may also work (in particular various BSD systems), but we don't actively test or maintain these.

### 1.3.1) Legacy support
Platforms, languages and compilers change.
We'll keep support going on old platforms as long as someone is interested in supporting them, except where it means the project can't move forward to keep up with language and compiler features.

We guarantee that every revision of OpenTTD will be able to load savegames from every older revision (excepting where the savegame is corrupt).
Please report a bug if you find a save that doesn't load.

## 1.4) Installing and running OpenTTD

OpenTTD is usually straightforward to install, but for more help the wiki [includes an installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).

OpenTTD needs some additional graphics and sound files to run.

For some platforms these will be downloaded during the installation process if required.

For some platforms, you will need to refer to [the installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).


### 1.4.1) Free graphics and sound files

The free data files, split into OpenGFX for graphics, OpenSFX for sounds and
OpenMSX for music can be found at:

- [OpenGFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opengfx-releases/latest)
- [OpenSFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opensfx-releases/latest)
- [OpenMSX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openmsx-releases/latest)

Please follow the readme of these packages about the installation procedure.
The Windows installer can optionally download and install these packages.


### 1.4.2) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sound files

If you want to play with the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files you have to copy the data files from the CD-ROM into the baseset/ directory.
It does not matter whether you copy them from the DOS or Windows version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
The Windows install can optionally copy these files.

You need to copy the following files:
- sample.cat
- trg1r.grf or TRG1.GRF
- trgcr.grf or TRGC.GRF
- trghr.grf or TRGH.GRF
- trgir.grf or TRGI.GRF
- trgtr.grf or TRGT.GRF


### 1.4.3) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe music

If you want the Transport Tycoon Deluxe music, copy the appropriate files from the original game into the baseset folder.
- TTD for Windows: All files in the gm/ folder (gm_tt00.gm up to gm_tt21.gm)
- TTD for DOS: The GM.CAT file
- Transport Tycoon Original: The GM.CAT file, but rename it to GM-TTO.CAT


## 1.5) Add-on content / mods

OpenTTD features multiple types of add-on content, which modify gameplay in different ways.

Most types of add-on content can be downloaded within OpenTTD via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.

Add-on content can also be installed manually, but that's more complicated; the [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) may offer help with that, or the [OpenTTD directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).


### 1.5.1) Social Integration

OpenTTD has the ability to load plugins to integrate with Social Platforms like Steam, Discord, etc.

To enable such integration, the plugin for the specific platform has to be downloaded and stored in the `social_integration` folder.

See [OpenTTD's website](https://www.openttd.org), under Downloads, for what plugins are available.


### 1.6) OpenTTD directories

OpenTTD uses its own directory structure to store game data, add-on content etc.

For more information, see the [directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).

### 1.7) Compiling OpenTTD

If you want to compile OpenTTD from source, instructions can be found in [COMPILING.md](./COMPILING.md).

### 2.1) Multiplayer games

You can play OpenTTD with others, either cooperatively or competitively.

See the [multiplayer documentation](./docs/multiplayer.md) for more details.


### 2.2) Contributing to OpenTTD

We welcome contributors to OpenTTD.  More information for contributors can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)


### 2.3) Reporting bugs

Good bug reports are very helpful.  We have a [guide to reporting bugs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports) to help with this.

Desyncs in multiplayer are complex to debug and report (some software development skils are required).
Instructions can be found in [debugging and reporting desyncs](./docs/debugging_desyncs.md).


### 2.4) Translating

OpenTTD is translated into many languages.  Translations are added and updated via the [online translation tool](https://translator.openttd.org).

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.  h t t p : / / s c r i p t s . s i l . o r g / O F L  http://scripts.sil.org/OFL  O p e n T T D   M o n o  OpenTTD Mono  B o l d  Bold  O p e n T T D   M o n o  OpenTTD Mono  B o l d  Bold            <                              	 

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.  h t t p : / / s c r i p t s . s i l . o r g / O F L  http://scripts.sil.org/OFL  O p e n T T D   S a n s  OpenTTD Sans  B o l d  Bold  O p e n T T D   S a n s  OpenTTD Sans  B o l d  Bold            <                              	 

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.  h t t p : / / s c r i p t s . s i l . o r g / O F L  http://scripts.sil.org/OFL  O p e n T T D   S m a l l  OpenTTD Small  R e g u l a r  Regular  O p e n T T D   S m a l l  OpenTTD Small  R e g u l a r  Regular           (                              	 

- Fix: [NoGo] Some news messages would cause an assertion to be triggered due to a missing proper location for the viewport of the news message, so only allow building when valid data for the viewport is provided or no viewport is used [FS#5054] (r23924)
- Fix: Consider only the middle tile of a lock for lock-infrastructure costs. The other two tiles may be owned by other companies. Also do not count the middle tile of a lock as canal, independent of whether it is build on ground or river slope (r23920)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When determining the first refittable cargotype according to CTT order, do not rely on the GRF assigning the refit_mask property. Also check for GRFs setting the default_cargo or refittable-cargo-classes or -types properties (r23916)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Do not test validity of cargobits using a mask of cargoslots (r23914)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: [NewGRF] Give NewGRF defined level crossings and rail depots access to the townzone (r23866)
- Feature: [NewGRF] New algorithm (activated via an engine flag) to determine the capacity of vehicles. This allows vehicles to better control the capacity for cargotypes which they know; and let cargo NewGRFs influence the capacity for cargoes the vehicle NewGRF does not know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes (r23861)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add cargo property 1D to set the capacity multipliers when refitting vehicles, which do not use callback 15 (r23860)

- Fix: Infrastructure cache could get out of sync when overbuilding a drive through road stop (r23851)
- Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but accidentally create a station order and then copy the vehicle's order (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion from the pool [FS#5008] (r23849)
- Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed infrastructure (r23847)

- Fix: Infrastructure count of canals/locks/ship depots was not updated properly when a company went into bankruptcy or was taken over [FS#4921] (r23686)
- Fix: When fitting another engine the cargo capacity of wagons could become lower, causing them to contain more than they should. This caused the cargo transfer from the replaced parts to put even more stuff in the already full wagon. Prevent this from happening by reducing the amount of cargo in the vehicle to the capacity when moving vehicles/wagons around, or when autoreplacing [FS#4912] (r23683)
- Fix: Vehicle numbers got miscounted when autoreplacing failed due to length checks [FS#4914] (r23681)

- Fix: Old TTO/TTD savegames could get non-stop via orders upon savegame loading, even when those orders did not exist back then. This 'conversion' feature is something for TTDPatch and old OpenTTD savegames [FS#4716] (r22914)

- Fix: When a game uses a lot of NewGRFs the buffer for storing that information in the PNG is too small (r22388)
- Fix: Windows' recv seems to return 'graceful closed' before having passed the remaining buffer which causes OpenTTD to think all connections are 'incorrectly' terminated, i.e. without the 'I am leaving' packet from the client. So let the client wait a tiny bit after sending the 'I am leaving' packet and before gracefully closing the connection [FS#4601] (r22387)
- Fix: When the last AI company gets removed, the 'dead' state was not reset in the AI debug window [FS#4602] (r22386)

- Fix: Crash when clicking a removed company in the vehicle list dropdowns [FS#4592] (r22373)
- Fix: Keep better accounting of the order in which clients joined; client cannot be starved from joining and they get shown the amount of clients waiting in front of them (r22372, r22370, r22369, r22368, r22367, r22366, r22365, r22364, r22363, r22362, r22361)
- Fix: Make sure saving has completely and utterly finished before starting a new one. Otherwise you could start a save, which would be marked as done by the previous save stopping and then yet another save could be started... and that could create a deadlock [FS#4596] (r22371)
- Fix: Delete the client list popup when the client got removed (instead of previously selecting some other client) (r22360, r22359, r22358)
- Fix: When inserting automatic orders, do not create consecutive duplicate orders (r22333, r22332, r22331, r22330, r22329, r22328, r22327)
- Fix: Destinations of conditional orders were update incorrectly when deleting orders in front of the conditional orders, if the target order was the order just before of the conditional order (r22326)
- Fix: Vehicles skipped orders when inserting automatic orders failed (r22324)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When determining refittability use the cargo translation table of the GRF setting the refitmask instead of the GRF defining the action 3 (r22316)
- Fix: Make road vehicles, ships and aircraft skip orders if they are leaving a depot and heading to the same one again; just like trains (r22309)
- Fix: Waiting on a server could kick the client, or rather the client would kick itself due to an unexpected packet [FS#4574] (r22308)
- Fix: When drawing the town authority window, check whether the availability of the actions changed, and force a complete redraw in that case (r22307)
- Fix: The 'freeform edges' setting could be enabled when there were buoys on the northern border [FS#4580] (r22297)
- Fix: Reset Window::scrolling_scrollbar when raising scrollbar buttons [FS#4571] (r22294)


1.1.0 (2011-04-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: In the scenario editor you could build a ship depot using the appropriate hotkey. Removing that depot causes an assertion to trigger [FS#4558] (r22266)


1.1.0-RC3 (2011-03-18)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: New game settings were applied too early when starting a game via a heightmap [FS#4557] (r22259)
- Fix: Do not resort town, industry and signs list directly in OnInvalidateData(). There might be a scheduled rebuild which needs execution first. So, only set a trigger for resorting [FS#4546] (r22249, r22248, r22247, r22246, r22245, r22244, r22243, r22242, r22241, r22236, r22228, r22227, r22226)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Object variable 0x48 was not available in callback 0x15C (r22231)
- Fix: Compilation when compiling with --disable-ai (r22222)
- Fix: When downloading a file via HTTP failed mid-way and OpenTTD fell back to the old system the partial downloaded amount would be counted twice [FS#4543] (r22208)
- Fix: The 'center' (for movement) of vehicles is (currently still) always at 4/8th original vehicle length from the front, so trains should stop at the same location regardless of the length of the front engine [FS#4545] (r22206)
- Fix: Make the base costs for building and demolishing NewObjects also local to the individual NewGRFs (r22204)
- Fix: Removing a station order could stop when removing first automatic order (r22200)
- Fix: Invalidate the object build window when using the date cheat (r22193)


1.1.0-RC2 (2011-03-04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Following a vehicle with a very high VehicleID was impossible (r22181)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak if an industry NewGRF had more than one prop A or 15, or a station NewGRF had more than one prop 09 (r22175, r22165)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a station NewGRF when it contains an unterminated spritelayout in action0 prop 08 instead of crashing (r22164)
- Fix: Building a station part adjacent to both an existing station and a rail waypoint failed [FS#4541] (r22163)
- Fix: No update of NewGRF window when unknown GRF name becomes available [FS#4533] (r22162)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Industry prop 0x11 is 4-bytes long, not 3 bytes (r22157)
- Fix: Stations/infrastructure were not properly sold on some clients during bankruptcy [FS#4529] (r22154)
- Fix: The Greek translation did not work as it breached the 200.000 bytes 'limit' for loading language files [FS#4536] (r22153)
- Fix: Windows video driver crashed when it could not go to full screen at the resolution of the configuration file when starting OpenTTD [FS#4521] (r22149)
- Fix: Do not run savegame conversion during SlNullPointers; the pointer might not be converted or be NULL at that point (r22146)
- Fix: Some valid keycodes were ignored along with the invalid ones (r22142)
- Fix: When commands need to invalidate windows, process these events asynchronously before the next redraw. Calling window code directly from command scope uses wrong _current_company and might issue nested DoCommands() which interfere with the running command [FS#4523] (r22141, r22140, r22135, r22134)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Skipping only the invalid part of an action14 failed, the rest of the action was skipped instead (r22138)
- Fix: Spectators had crashes when closing buoy windows (r22131)
- Fix: Build-station-window showed wrong selection when reopening [FS#4530] (r22128)
- Fix: Canals would get drawn as land in the smallmap when using the owner window (r22127)
- Fix: The animation-ness of two goldmine tiles were swapped, causing the wheeltower to not work properly, and the bottom corner to show the wrong sprite [FS#4528] (r22125)
- Fix: CommandQueue::Pop() did not update 'last'; popping the last item caused the queue to disconnect unless there was only one item [FS#4522] (r22123)
- Fix: When a NOT_REACHED in saveload can be reached due to an invalid savegame, use SlErrorCorrupt instead. In other words, do not crash but show an error message (r22122)
- Fix: In case of high frame_freq one could get commands executed after a new network game was started (r22121)
- Fix: [NoAI] Prevent AIs from getting consistently over their allowed amount of operations by subtracting the amount they went over 'budget' from the budget for the next 'tick' (r22120)
- Fix: The refit window was not correctly updated after selecting with Ctrl+Click [FS#4525] (r22118)
- Fix: CanRemoveRoadWithStop() failed for _current_company = OWNER_TOWN, and for OWNER_NONE-owned road (r22117)

- Feature: Wheel scrolling in the console (r21982)
- Feature: Console command to reset the engine pool. It removes the traces of engines which are no longer associated to a NewGRF, and can be used to e.g. 'fix' scenarios which were screwed up by the author. You can only use it when there are no vehicles in the game though (r21975)
- Feature: Add a setting to enable/disable funding local road reconstruction (r21974)
- Feature: Introduce 'minimal' number of industries as a replacement for the old 'none' setting in the new game window (r21969)
- Change: When loading old savegames with long trains set the maximum train length to the length of the longest train (r22061)
- Change: Always report mammoth trains are disabled to NewGRFs, and allow the maximum train length to be modified in multiplayer as well [FS#4471] (r22004)
- Fix: Remove invalid keycodes when reading hotkeys.cfg [FS#4510] (r22094)
- Fix: The server list did not get sorted with one item in it, so the 'position in the list' variable was never updated causing problems when using the keyboard shortcuts for scrolling [FS#4514] (r22093)
- Fix: When deleting towns, only relocate objects during DC_EXEC (r22087)
- Fix: [Windows] If fullscreen fails with current resolution, use desktop resolution [FS#4489] (r22081)
- Fix: The owner view of the smallmap was not updated after a company colour change (r22079)
- Fix: Maximum train length interfered with wagon replacement when wagon removal was turned on [FS#4499] (r22078)
- Fix: NewGRFs with invalid multi-tile houses could cause a valid 1x1 house following it to be seen as multi-tile, causing crashes [FS#4501] (r22075)
- Fix: Immediately update the train weight when you change the multiplier for train cargo weight (r22073)
- Fix: Some hotkey names in hotkey.cfg for the scenario editor toolbar were completely bogus (r22071)
- Fix: Crashes when disconnecting after requesting the map [FS#4503] (r22070)
- Fix: Delete all savegame packets, not just the first one (r22069)
- Fix: Return 'connection lost' instead of 'okay' when SendPackets closed the connection, so we do not try to do anything else with the closed socket (r22068)
- Fix: Do not hold a mutex when sending packets and thus possibly closing the connection as that wants to acquire the mutex again (r22067)
- Fix: Verify we can allocate an Order, OrderList, CargoPacket, CargoPayment, and others before we actually try to do so (all corner cases) [FS#4468] (r22066, r22057, r22047, r22042, r22040, r22033, r22031, r22026, r22025, r22024, r22023, r22022)
- Fix: Crash when disconnecting and reconnecting while the server is still saving the savegame [FS#4497] (r22064)
- Fix: Memory leak when saving with LZMA or zlib fails mid-way (r22062)
- Fix: Make the send chat message window follow the position of the status bar (r22059)
- Fix: Metric and imperial HP are not the same. As imperial HP are used internally, set a conversion rate for metric HP [FS#4408] (r22056)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Some invalid squirrel code caused the squirrel compiler to crash [FS#4490] (r22055)
- Fix: The land area information window was not updated after a language change (r22053)
- Fix: Roads under road stops would get a wrong owner after overbuilding (r22051)
- Fix: In ancient savegames, e.g. TTO savegames, non primary vehicles (wagons and such) could have unitnumbers or even orders. However, these orders would not be updated when a station is removed. As such some savegames have wagons with current orders to invalid stations which triggers trouble in the load conversion. So, trash any orders/unitnumbers a non-primary vehicle has [FS#4496] (r22050)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Company 0 does not always exist, so put temporary vehicles in a valid company (r22048)

- Fix: The server list got not resorted/redrawn after NewGRFs were downloaded [FS#4482] (r22029)
- Fix: When paused and having the allowed actions while paused setting on 'no actions' cheating money would fail [FS#4479] (r22016)
- Fix: Only show one AI per unique ID instead of all versions in the output of 'openttd -h' (r22007)
- Fix: Smoke/sparks of trains would be shown under bridges, or rather through bridges [FS#4480] (r22006)
- Fix: When the difference between force and resistance is smaller than the mass(*4) there would be no acceleration anymore, even when at higher (or lower) speed the force and resistance balance out better [FS#4473] (r21997)
- Fix: [YAPF] Under some circumstances vehicles could be lost [FS#4472] (r21996)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Make computations of closest-land/water-distances handle waterish tiles more correctly (r21994)
- Fix: When building a lock on dry land costs for clearing water were deducted rather than for building canals (r21993)
- Fix: AIs trying to change the AIOF_GOTO_NEAREST_DEPOT flag for existing orders triggered an assert. Explicitly forbid this as precondition for SetOrderFlags [FS#4467] (r21992)
- Fix: The share/copy-orders-cursor was not updated to refer to the new vehicle when it got autoreplaced/-renewed [FS#4466] (r21991)

- Change: Replace longbridges settings with custom maximum bridge and tunnel length setting (r21959)
- Change: Randomise the vehicle a small UFO targets, do not use the one with lowest index (r21949)
- Fix: Do not count the number of vehicles but the length of vehicles to (configurably) limit train length [FS#4461] (r21960)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Reset the carry flag every 4 bytes in Action 6 when adding more than one variable (r21951)

- Fix: Allow to overbuild road stops which are built over trams (r21935)
- Fix: Automatic orders behave now stable wrt. service orders and are not added or removed depending on the need of servicing [FS#4440] (r21933)
- Fix: The town window would not be invalidated in the scenario editor if the ground changed and thus the required cargoes for town growth [FS#4554] (r21929)

- Fix: Languages improperly sorted in the 'start server' window [FS#4443] (r21918)
- Fix: The minimum speed needed for (realistic) acceleration to work properly can sometimes be more than the (temporary) maximum speed causing Clamp to 'fail'. Make sure that the minimum speed always overrules the maximum speed [FS#4442] (r21916)
- Fix: Include the capacity of non-refittable vehicles in the refitted-capacity, if their cargo matches (r21904)
- Fix: Do not count articulated parts when passing the number of vehicles to refit to the command. That may exceed 8 bits (r21902)
- Fix: [NoAI] Hide automatic orders from AIs as they have no way of dealing with them (r21900)
- Fix: Do not show a vehicle selection in the RefitWindow for refit orders. You cannot select anything anyway (r21899)
- Fix: Using a pointer-iterator and adding things (thus reallocating) to the iterated array caused OpenTTD to crash on invalid pointers [FS#4438] (r21898)
- Fix: Only some scenarios from the main scenario folder and no heightmaps could be started in the 'start server' window [FS#4421] (r21892)

- Fix: When a single-vehicle train was reversed while on a slope, its GOINGUP/DOWN were not swapped (r21874)
- Remove: Settings for vehicle speed in the vehicle view, long date in status bar, drawing of bridge pillars, support for depot orders, time tabling and joining of stations upon building (r21958, r21957, r21956, r21955, r21954)
- Remove: The non-uniform stations setting; it has been broken for over a year, and thus not used [FS#4456] (r21953)

- Change: Keep aqueducts and road/tram tunnels and bridges after removing a company (r21780)
- Fix: Distant-join station would build at the wrong location when having persistent building turned on and selecting a 'second' location for the station tile [FS#4430] (r21864)
- Fix: Slowing down of trains was done by reducing the speed by 10%, but also when you are just 1% too fast, so limit the slowdown till the new maximum speed [FS#4423] (r21847)
- Fix: Left-mouse-button dragging would switch over to other viewports instead of staying locked to the viewport you started on [FS#4419] (r21837)
- Fix: When a train was reversed while inside a tunnel/bridge, it would not have (re)set the GOINGUP/DOWN bits after leaving the tunnel/bridge (r21836)

- Fix: Allow dragging of combo signals (again) [FS#4378] (r21816)
- Fix: [YAPF] Apply a pathfinder penalty for back of one-way path signals so those are not preferred over other possibilities [FS#3908] (r21815)

- Fix: Crash when displaying the owner view [FS#4411] (r21813)
- Fix: Do not create automatic orders when there are no manual orders, and remove unreached automatic orders when reaching an ordered waypoint or depot [FS#4404] (r21809, r21808)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Command logging using the admin interface (r21668)

- Add: [NoAI] AIEventTownFounded (r21664)
- Add: [NoAI] AIRail::GetName() to get the name of a railtype (r21663)
- Add: [NoAI] AITown::IsCity() so AIs can find out which towns grow faster than others (r21654)
- Change: Do not show price to build a bridge in the scenario editor as they are free to build there [FS#4358] (r21673)
- Change: Do not highlight tile when selecting a vehicle to clone or an order to skip to (r21616)

- Fix: Cargo payment graph was not properly invalidated when payment rate changed [FS#4351] (r21658)
- Fix: Use a bool instead of uint8 to store a bool and use the dedicated accessor function when reading boolean settings [FS#4345] (r21656)
- Fix: Infinite loop in the road pathfinder due to bouncing around in an 'one way' trap; two one ways pointing towards each other making it impossible to leave [FS#4338] (r21651)
- Fix: Make '[centre|main] view' consistent, and make '[main|global] view' consistent [FS#4339] (r21650)
- Fix: Newly created skip-to order was created at wrong place (r21633)
- Fix: Ships with the old pathfinder would easily show up as lost, even when it would eventually find a path. Now also the distance from the 'end' of the pathfinding run to the destination is compared to the current distance to the destination; if the distance to the destination at the end of the pathfinder run is less than the current distance from the destination the ship will not be marked as lost. This means that the ships with the old pathfinder will less likely get marked as lost, but due to the design of the old ship pathfinder there 'lostness' is merely a best guess. When you still get a lost message you need to build buoys to guide the ship pathfinder [FS#4325] (r21631)
- Fix: Version detection of subversion branches and tags got broken (r21630)
- Fix: Crash under certain circumstances when using autorail [FS#4327] (r21619)

- Feature: Building while paused always works in the scenario editor [FS#1521] (r21430)
- Feature: Perform the compression of savegames to send to the client asynchronously. This will reduce the lag of the other clients to the time it takes to make the memory dump and it will speed up downloading the map as the download starts earlier (possibly with a slightly lower bandwidth due to slow compression) [FS#4284] (r21399)
- Feature: Do not store savegames to disk when transferring it from the server to a client (r21398, r21397)

- Feature: XZ/LZMA2 savegame support. New default reduces savegame size by 10 to 30% with slightly more CPU usage. With maximum settings it reduces savegame size by 20 to 30%, but that takes 7 to 14 times longer. Map saving + downloading takes, on average, 5% less (r21044)
- Feature: Chat directly to the server or a bot/admin/IRC channel monitoring the server (r21000)
- Feature: Remote administration (r20975-r20963)
- Feature: [NewGRF] The concept of minimum loadable version to NewGRFs when choosing compatible NewGRFs (r20960, r20958)
- Feature: Centre new extra viewports on the tile below the mouse. Only centre on centre of main viewport if mouse is not in any viewport (r20956)

- Feature: [NewGRF] AdvVarAct2 operators for SHL, SHR and SAR (r20332)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Air drag property support for trains and road vehicles. Air drag for vehicles with air drag not set or set to zero will use a default value depending on their max speed (r20303, r20302, r20301, r20300, r20299)
- Feature: More user-friendly gui to change NewGRF parameters (r20258)

- Feature: Hide all other industries when Ctrl+clicking an industry type in smallmap legend (r19770)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Access to random bits of houses and industries from construction callbacks 17, 28 and 2F. That is: The random bits the house/industry will start with, if construction succeeds [FS#3477] (r19744)
- Feature: A simple sprite alignment helper. It does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets (r19723)
- Feature: New base costs for building/clearing canals, building/clearing aqueducts and building/clearing locks (r19720)

- Feature: Console command 'reload_newgrfs'; only available when NewGRF developer tools are enabled (r19515)
- Feature: Enter the starting year in the scenario editor by clicking at the date panel (r19397)

- Add: Support for MSVC 2010 (r20032)
- Add: [NoAI] AIIndustry::GetIndustryID(TileIndex) (r19773)
- Change: Make it possible to start actions that require selecting stuff (landscaping, vehicle cloning, etc) in the viewport while paused. As side-effect you will get an error message explaining the command cannot be executed because the game is paused instead of seemingly nothing happening when you click. Additional side effect of this is that you can make use of the measurement tooltip while paused [FS#4292] (r21480)
- Change: Make building aqueducts behave more like building tunnels. They cannot be built on flat (or foundation) tiles, so there is at most one destination tile like there is only one for tunnels [FS#4153] (r21471)
- Change: Place the bridge building window under the mouse instead of somewhere randomly on the screen and change the default sort order [FS#3975] (r21460)
- Change: Make sure the client is listening, or rather receiving, our frames (r21361)
- Change: Read some metadata from (official) source tarballs so you will more likely get the right version/revision out-of-the-box (r21351)
- Change: Be more explicit that the game state can get broken by changing NewGRFs (r21335)
- Change: Use the last red instead of last red exit penalty for making sure other waypoint entries are evaluated as well when they are occupied, e.g. when there are no signals before the waypoint but a train just beyond the waypoint is stopped (like for stations) (r21271)
- Change: Do not receive money for removing the rail of non-rail rail station tiles, i.e. rail station tiles for which the NewGRF has prevented trains to be routed through (r21266)
- Change: Show a different 'lag' message when a client is lagging because of connection trouble or lagging because the client is just slow (r21254)
- Change: Mention the OpenTTD version on the console/logs when starting an OpenTTD dedicated server like we mention it in the title bar for the GUI version (r21253)

- Change: Limit the number of exceptions in the refittable cargo list to 7 (r21083)
- Change: Reduce the chances to accidentally break savegames with NewGRFs by limiting loading of savegames that miss NewGRFs or change NewGRF settings in-game [FS#3012] (r21116)
- Change: Tuned realistic acceleration to be a bit more realistic in order to make acceleration 'slower', which highlights the differences between vehicle types more (r21106)
- Change: Do not make client reconnect waiting time depend on the company; in coop games that does not spread clients at all, and most companies have a low number causing it not to be spread out either. Use the ClientID instead (r21008)
- Change: Add installing options or rather options to not install certain documentation, in a similar way to GRFCodec/catcodec (r20999)
- Change: Only display liveries in the livery window if they are used by some vehicle somewhen (r20849)
- Change: [NoAI] Rename AIAbstractList to AIList (r20563)
- Change: [NoAI] AIOrder::GetOrderFlags returns AIOrder::AIOF_INVALID for void orders (r20389)
- Change: [NewGRF] Adapt vehicle var FE bit 6 to new railtypes (r20175)
- Change: [NewGRF] Call callbacks 14A, 14B and 14C after all industry variables have been assigned, so more variables are valid during the callbacks (r19907)
- Change: [NoAI] Remove HasNext() from all lists/iterators and add IsEnd() instead (r19294)
- Change: Add the default installation directory of lzo/zlib for Mac OS X/MinGW to the paths where (the headers of) those libraries are searched [FS#3638] (r19285)
- Fix: Crash due to cargo payments belonging to a non-existing company [FS#4324] (r21605)
- Fix: Company league table used stats from two quarters ago instead of last quarter [FS#4323] (r21601)
- Fix: The default visual effect only depends on properties of the Engine (wagon or not, tractiontype, ...), not whether it is used as articulated part, front engine or whatever in a specific consist [FS#4275] (r21598)
- Fix: [OSX] A double mouse cursor was shown under certain circumstances [FS#2585] (r21578)
- Fix: Show 'plant trees' button lowered on the terraform toolbar, like how other buttons are lowered when you selected a 'build' action [FS#4315] (r21539)
- Fix: 2CC recolour sprites were the same for DOS and WIN palette, thus 'dark green', 'brown', 'grey' and 'white' were wrong for DOS [FS#4312] (r21535)
- Fix: Do not apply the last signal red pathfinder penalty when the signal is a path signal [FS#4302] (r21524)
- Fix: Tooltips were not removed when their related window got closed [FS#4300] (r21477)

- Fix: [NewGRF] A NewGRF with incomplete string codes at the end of a string could cause invalid memory reads (r21433)
- Fix: The server did not check for the paused state when allowing to execute commands [FS#3771] (r21429)
- Fix: Vehicles could be built while the game is paused. Now you can enable or disable that with a setting, which replaces the build-while-paused cheat [FS#4021] (r21428)
- Fix: Purchase lists were not invalidated when using 'resetengines' (r21374)
- Fix: Fields were not cleared under snow though they were intended to be [FS#4283] (r21367)

- Fix: Under some circumstances two vehicles could leave a non drive-through road stop at once [FS#3935] (r21263)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Custom station foundations using the 'simple foundations'-method did not draw any sprite for WSE-slopes when there are foundations on both neighboured tiles in the north. As there must be at least one sprite to provide the correct offset for the groundsprite draw the (empty) default foundation sprite in that case [FS#4246] (r21262)
- Fix: The main menu error messages would not show when you had an error message open in the game while whatever triggered you to go back to the main menu (r21255)
- Fix: Rescanning AIs did not 'forget' removed AIs [FS#3952] (r21250)
- Fix: Upon rescanning AIs the new AIs would (after some time) show up in the AI list but you could not select all (r21246)
- Fix: [YAPF] Road vehicles not finding the nearest depot in some (corner) cases [FS#4130] (r21229)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The specs' cargo strings and OpenTTD's use of the clashed. Provide properties so NewGRFs can provide cargo strings tailored for OpenTTD while retaining (some) backward compatibility [FS#4172] (r21224)
- Fix: Use proper plural for the short cargo unit names (r21223)

- Fix: Station list was not updated when a new cargo got a rating (r21145)
- Fix: Station ratings were not updated (anymore) after an aircraft crashed (r21137)
- Fix: Bridge speed limits should apply to all wagons of a vehicle, not just the head of the vehicle [FS#4213] (r21136)
- Fix: Helicopter flight altitude was determined inconsistently in different places (r21119)
- Fix: Do not use the maximum track speed where the maximum vehicle speed is meant (r21107)

- Fix: Refit costs were not shown for long cargo names [FS#4160] (r20921)
- Fix: When using non-smooth or NewGRF-economy changing production rates does not work, so allow changing the production multiplier instead (r20901)
- Fix: The station with the second highest rating was doubly penalised when distributing cargo. Now the penalty is completely removed and the granularity/precision of the distribution in increased by using fractional cargo. This should make competing stations less all-or-nothing [FS#3637] (r20857)
- Fix: Make sure (gradual) loading is properly terminated for consists with multiple cargo types. Do not stop loading if the timetabled wait is not over yet [FS#2534] (r20843)

- Fix: 'Service at nearest depot' behaved the same as 'Go to nearest depot' [FS#3986] (r20229)
- Fix: Depot did not become unsnowy, when snowline rises [FS#3976] (r20224)

This can happen in two ways: with frame_freq > 1 a command received in a previous frame might not be executed yet or when a command is received in the same frame as the join but before the savegame is made. In both cases the joining client would not get all commands to get in-sync with the server (and the other clients) (r19620)

- Fix: Window::OnResize() was not always called while resizing a window causing incorrect windows [FS#3730] (r19563, r19558)
- Fix: Bridge build error message should not show the same message twice (r19560, r19559)
- Fix: [NewGRF] During NewGRF loading, store rail type labels in temporary data and process after loading has finished. This avoids deactivated rail vehicles being reactivated if the climate property is set after the rail type property (r19557, r19502)
- Fix: Improperly scaled cargo payment graph when having lots of cargo (r19550, 19543)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Properties set before property 08 (house, industry, industry tiles) should be ignored, not trigger the NewGRF to be disabled [FS#3725] (r19547)
- Fix: Sorting industries by production was broken for NewGRF industries (r19538)
- Fix: Vehicle details window did not resize correctly after refitting a road vehicle to a longer variant [FS#3720] (r19533)
- Fix: Prevent drawing industries disabled at the smallmap as land tiles when they are built on water (r19523)
- Fix: Tunnels, bridges and road stops are build with only one roadtype (r19506)

- Change: Use zł instead of zl for the Polish Zloty [FS#565] (r18434)
- Change: Show different texts in town GUI when the town does not need food the whole year to grow (r18433)
- Change: Make road vehicles behave more like trains 'around' stations and use pathfinder penalties to determine to which 'part' to go (r18382)
- Change: Do not split up articulated vehicles in the train details view. If an articulated vehicle it too 'wide' draw the information on the next line and if there are multiple cargoes split that over multiple lines too [FS#2923] (r18344)
- Change: Make pause on join pause during the whole joining (including download) phase [FS#3287] (r18054)
- Change: Prefer extmidi over allegro midi and allegro over null driver [FS#3272] (r17875)
- Change: Several improvements to the performance of CargoPackets/CargoLists; time spent in those functions reduces by 55-85% (r17840, r17836, r17818, r17814, r17812, r17801, r17736, r17735, r17733, r17731, r17730)
- Change: [SDL] Make 'update the video card'-process asynchronous. Improvements of 2%-25% (real time) during fast forward on dual core/hyperthreading-enabled CPUs (r17776)
- Change: [NoAI] Make AIEngine:CanRefitCargo() not report refittability to Mail by default for aircraft. It is not necessarily true, and the special case of carrying both passenger&mail is better handled by AIs themself than by the API (r17719)
- Change: [OSX] Do not use deprecated methods/undocumented functions [FS#1411] (r17712, r17711)
- Change: Make SDL's video driver more likely to be loaded than Allegro's video driver; SDL seems to perform better (r17583)
- Change: Do not assume that there is always 'another' industry tile after two '0x18' industry tiles (r17521)
- Change: Make the performance ratings harder to exploit; only count profitable vehicles and recently serviced stations [FS2459] (r17485)
- Change: When removing a station or waypoint keep the rail unless Ctrl is pressed. This makes the behaviour consistent between the two (r17471)
- Change: Show the client id in join messages at the server (r17467)
- Change: NewGRF price modifiers now take effect every time when loading NewGRFs instead of once on gamestart (r17433)

- Change: Update MiniLZO to 2.0.3 (r17215)
- Change: Update Squirrel to 2.2.3 (r17195)
- Change: Remove UNICODE notice in windows installer (r17186)
- Change: Apply the subsidy when subsidy's destination is in station's catchment area and cargo packets originate from subsidy's source [FS#265,FS#2094,FS#2589] (r17113)
- Change: Subsidies are not bound to stations after awarding anymore, they still apply to town or industry, no matter what station is used for loading and unloading. Awarded subsidies from older savegames are lost [FS#1134] (r17113)
- Change: [NoAI] Add AIBaseStation as a parentclass for AIStation and AIWaypoint, and move GetName, SetName and GetLocation to AIBaseStation (r17011)
- Fix: Conditional orders were seen as 'valid' and as such aircraft with only conditional orders did not crash (r18615)
- Fix: Pressing default for the starting year/snow line height edit boxes of the world generation windows did not work [FS#3398] (r18586)
- Fix: [OSX] Try to get a generic RGB colour space if getting the system colour profile failed [FS#3198] (r18573)
- Fix: [NewGRF] House property 15 did not work [FS#2613] (r18567)
- Fix: Do not try to overtake a vehicle in a road station as overtaking in a station is not allowed [FS#3390] (r18561)
- Fix: Make aircraft behave the same on autoreplace/autorenew as other vehicle types (r18553)
- Fix: First do the time-since-last-service check and only then determine whether autoreplace needs to take place. This way they will not keep autoreplacing continuously on failure, but only after some timeout. Also check some minimal requirements (engine availability, refittability) and a heuristic for the needed money when sending vehicles for autoreplace [FS#1762] (r18551, r18549)
- Fix: Do not account for path reservation costs when entering a signal block via a 'block' signal. This way you will not get double penalties, both red signals and reservation costs, for the block signalled tracks [FS#2722] (r18535)
- Fix: [NewGRF] An industry NewGRF that defined a too small size for action0 prop 0A could cause a crash (r18527)
- Fix: Allegro does not like to work with extmidi, so warn the user about that [FS#3272] (r18520)
- Fix: When you pass a signal at danger, in a PBS controlled area, do not try to do the 'safe' thing and stop, but continue going; the user wanted the train to pass the signal at danger so they have to suffer the consequences. Of course one can always stop the train manually [FS#2891] (r18515)
- Fix: No error message was created for the first fatal NewGRF error [FS#3368] (r18506)
- Fix: Improve airport movement on several airports [FS#3169] (r18505)
- Fix: Autoreplace and autorenew always reset their cargo sub type to 0. Now find a sub cargo type with the exact same name and use that, otherwise fallback to 0. So cargo sub types can be maintained via autoreplace *if* the new vehicle supports the same cargo sub type [FS#3159] (r18499)
- Fix: Cloning of vehicles could create vehicles with invalid cargo sub types for the build year of the vehicle. Fall back to another cargo sub type with the exact same name, otherwise fallback to cargo sub type 0 [FS#2616] (r18498)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Direction is accounted for long before motion counter is updated (r18479)
- Fix: Moving vehicles around/selling vehicle in the train depot could create states that are not allowed by the NewGRF attach callback [FS#3146] (r18472, r18470)
- Fix: Unselect an AI in the AI Settings window when it falls out of the range of active AIs [FS#3357] (r18436)
- Fix: Road vehicles would not pick an empty drive through stop. Now they will *if* the penalty for driving around is less than the occupancy penalty [FS#1944] (r18404)
- Fix: Long (articulated) road vehicles could block loading of others when the following road vehicle already got 'permission' to go to the next bay even when it could not reach it [FS#1495] (r18404)
- Fix: The tree 'which one to draw' hash was not anywhere near random and thus showed a very visible repeated pattern when only one tree type was used [FS#3343] (r18398)
- Fix: [NoAI] Make AIIndustryType::GetConstructionCost() return -1, if the industry is neither buildable nor prospectable (r18276)
- Fix: Use free type ascender/descender metrics to position font offset correctly (r18096)
- Fix: Make the 'pause' chat message when actually executing the pause command. This to prevent showing paused and especially unpaused to be shown when the state does not change. Output now mentions whether pause changes keep the game paused and what reasons for pausing there 'currently' are (r18052)
- Fix: [NoAI] Improve behaviour of (AIEngine|AIEventEnginePreview)::GetCargoType() and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() wrt. articulated vehicles (r17898)
- Fix: [NewGRF] CB15 and CB36 (capacity) were not always called when they should [FS#3255] (r17897)
- Fix: Invalidate cache of vehicle vars 40-43 after testruns of certain commands, that change them temporarily (r17894)
- Fix: [OSX] The splash image was not displayed if the Quartz video driver was used (r17793)
- Fix: Do not let aircraft drive a while over the grass when landing at high altitude airports [FS#3259] (r17762
- Fix: Make the -c <config file> location relative to the current directory instead of the directory of the binary [FS#3247] (r17686)
- Fix: Some semaphore signals fell outside of the signal GUI. Now the signals are properly centred which should make that problem go away [FS#3242] (r17657)
- Fix: Some inconsistencies with the difficulty settings in the scenario editor. Also re-enable changing some difficulty settings (e.g. max loan) in the scenario editor [FS#3219] (r17644)
- Fix: Do not accept cargo produced in the same industry; generalise and improve the check used only for valuables (r17437)
- Fix: Pay only for cargo actually delivered, not for all cargo unloaded at station; can differ with 'stockpiling' industries (r17436)
- Fix: Improve movement of aircraft; do not make turns bigger than 45 degrees while in flight, do not move while turning on the ground (r17415, r17405)
- Fix: Crash in order GUI when changing some orders with both the mouse and keyboard at the exact same time [FS#2859] (r17384)
- Fix: Trains would not show smoke if the load/unload counter was not 0, though there does not seem to be a reason to check that variable anyhow anymore [FS#3162] (r17352)
- Fix: One was not offered to take over bankrupt companies anymore; caused by the introduction NoAI, although NewAI had the same problem too [FS#2769] (r17345)
- Fix: Minor improvements of the airport state machines (r17338, r17337, r17334)
- Fix: Road vehicles forgetting their servicing order when the path takes them away (in bird distance) from their destination first [FS#3057] (r17333)
- Fix: Mention of Ctrl modifier was missing from some tooltips [FS#3120] (r17300, r17297)
- Fix: Keep vehicle news and viewports following vehicles, when autoreplacing/renewing them [FS#3048] (r17147)
- Fix: Inconsistency between signs of stations and waypoints [FS#3081] (r17040)
- Fix: NewGRF stations would be triggering assertions for waypoints all over the place when using the more advanced station types [FS#2996] (r16909)
- Fix: Skipping a 'nearest depot order' because none could be found could cause multiple orders to get skipped [FS#2925] (r16457)
- Fix: Makedepend cannot handle the amount of files we have and it also miss some dependencies. So use our custom implementation of makedepend (r16307)
- Fix: Autopause and manual pausing conflict with each other, new game + pause on new game + autopause make the game not unpause on the first join [FS#2864] (r16242)
- Remove: [NoAI] AIVehicle::SkipToVehicleOrder as it was a duplicate of AIOrder.SkipToOrder (r18504)
- Remove: OPF for RVs and NTP for trains; both the oldest path finders (r18362)
- Remove: Support for gcc2. It has not been able to compile OpenTTD for months. All attempts to do another workaround failed (r16492)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change: Prefer extmidi over allegro midi and allegro over null driver [FS#3272] (r17875)
- Change: [NewGRF] Apply default refitmasks only when the NewGRF did not set any of the three refittability properties (xor mask, positive classes, negative classes) (r17663)
- Fix: Crash when an articulated RV is turning on a drive through road station that gets forcefully (bankrupt) removed [FS#3310] (r18049)
- Fix: GCC 4.5 compiling (r18045)
- Fix: AIs failed to load their data from savegames by crashing them when they tried [FS#3290] (r18038)
- Fix: Screen jumped a bit for at least SDL and Allegro when right-click-dragging (r18030)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Improve parsing of RIFF data. Skip unknown chunks and check chunk sizes (r17999)
- Fix: When you start giving money (input window for amount), then get moved to spectators and you click 'Ok' a crash would occur (r17953)
- Fix: Use 24bpp BMP format instead of 32bpp for screenshots. Saves space and is supported by more image viewers (r17943)
- Fix: Close BMP file when making screenshot fails (r17941)
- Fix: Deadlock when trying to create screenshot with too long name (including path) (r17936)
- Fix: Crash when closing NewGRF parameter window with no NewGRF selected [FS#3291] (r17922)
- Fix: 32bpp BMP screenshots were in wrong colours on big endian machines and broken when screen width was not a multiple of 4 (r17910, r17909)
- Fix: Uninitialised values in some paths of loading TTO savegames [FS#3288] (r17908)
- Fix: Make the plane speed setting unchangeable in network games because it can be read by NewGRFs on game load and thus if it changes cause desyncs (r17902)
- Fix: [NewGRF] 'subtract-in' is also signed for production callback version 0 (r17857)
- Fix: [NewGRF] _date_fract runs from 0 to 73 since r2041. Variable 0x09 should not (r17824)
- Fix: Do not fail hard when no soundcard could be detected; just fall back on the null-driver [FS#3268] (r17788)
- Fix: CJK languages do not have spaces, so for adding newlines (multi line strings) we need to (properly) handle the case when there are no spaces instead of truncating the string [FS#3264] (r17772)
- Fix: Powernaut Helicopter got wrong 'load amount' (r17758)
- Fix: [NewGRF] 'last_value' and 'reseed' are shared between procedure and main chain, 'scope' and 'count' are not (r17672)
- Fix: Count only active clients (not those waiting for map download) when checking min_active_clients limit (r16506)


0.7.3 (2009-10-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: [NewGRF] Crash when trying to build an industry that has no industry layout defined [FS#3233] (r17638, r17633)

- Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak when viewing the NewGRF settings of a server (r17563)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The NewGRF settings of (remote) network games did not get properly updated when the NewGRFs were rescanned causing reading of freed data [FS#2972] (r17562)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Close the 'Add NewGRF' window when you close the 'NewGRF Settings' window. The add window has a pointer to the settings which means that not deleting it would cause dereferencing an already freed pointer [FS#3206] (r17559)
- Fix: Vehicles waiting for their time table did not load anymore after their initial load was completed [FS#3201] (r17551)
- Fix: Aircraft were given an unfair advantage in station rating calculations (r17550)

- Change: Make overbuilding the front tile of a road station/depot with road consistent with overbuilding the front tile of tunnels/bridges [FS#2802] (r17239)
- Change: Improve error output on missing or corrupt files (r17238)
- Change: [Unix] Only use colourised error output on interactive terminals (r17227)
- Change: [NoAI] Crash an AI when it uses a DoCommand/Sleep instead of just printing an error message in the AI Debug Window [FS#2980] (r17223)
- Change: [NoAI] When the API requests a string as parameter allow every squirrel type and convert to a string [FS#3101] (r17221)
- Change: Make strgen warn if the translation uses STRINGn or RAW_STRING instead of STRING (r17137, r17129)
- Change: [NoAI] Load the API before compiling an AI script so AIs can subclass API classes and use API constants as part of their own constants (r17043)
- Change: Add notion of Ctrl+Click in the tooltip for Loan borrow/repay buttons [FS#3066] (r16979)
- Change: [MSVC] Make all language files depend on english.txt (r16975)
- Change: There is no point in not randomising engine introduction-date before 1922. Instead disable the randomisation for the first two years after game-start, so you do not have to wait for the first engine (r16929)
- Fix: [Squirrel] In some cases the call stack would not be cleaned up properly during crash handling. Occasionally this causes asserts to be triggered or crashes [FS#3189] (r17515)
- Fix: When loading GRFConfigs from ini file, validate them wrt. duplicate GRF IDs [FS#3197] (r17510)
- Fix: When building a part fails during cloning, sell what was already cloned instead of leaving it 'for free'. Also make cloning multiheaded trains possible with with 'max - 1' vehicles existing [FS#3196] (r17509)
- Fix: [NoAI] The wrong value was restored to SetAllowDoCommand possible resulting in an AI that was not allowed to do any actions (r17500)
- Fix: Road vehicles could get lost when the preliminary destination (for the pathfinder heuristics) is unreachable [FS#3188] (r17491)
- Fix: When building roads is not allowed for town, then do not build the initial piece either [FS#3173] (r17444)
- Fix: Destruction of depots did not remove any vehicle lists related to the depot, causing windows pointing to deleted depots and (thus) crashes [FS#3180] (r17442)
- Fix: Economy recession would never end when economy is set to Steady while in recession (r17426)
- Fix: The index of orders loaded from old savegames was overwritten with an uninitialised value (r17419)
- Fix: Incomplete check on validity of industry type when building industries (r17413)

0.7.0-RC1 (2009-03-16)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Pop up the AI Debug Window if one of the AIs crashed and show a message that the user should report the crash [FS#2728] (r15708)
- Feature: Allow the number of towns that will be generated in the generate world window to be customised [FS#2672] (r15695)
- Fix: Enabling freeform edges could cause submarines to get stuck on land tiles (r15733)
- Fix: Centring on a vehicle did not respect its z coordinate (r15725)
- Fix: Do not show passenger-/mail-capacity if the aircraft carries only cargo (r15705)
- Fix: Blame NewGRFs returning inconsistent information in purchase-list/after building before users have a chance to blame OpenTTD for incorrectly autorenewing/-replacing [FS#2595] (r15701)
- Fix: Just sell the old engines after autorenew/replace. Do not bother about trains exceeding the trainlimit, which will be sold anyway [FS#2721] (r15692)
- Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [FS#2720] (r15689)
- Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the 'map generation' sprites with garbage [FS#2720] (r15685)
- Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [FS#2546] (r15677)
- Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [FS#2718] (r15667)
- Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into account when ordering by capacity [FS#2689] (r15666)
- Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)
- Fix: Growing of vsize as (some) threads were not properly released (r15663)
- Fix: Do not mark a company as having ratings in a town when querying the cost of a command (r15662)

- Feature: Show required/already-delivered cargo needed for town-growth in town-view-window and only if it is really needed (r15559)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support vehicle vars 0x47 and 0xF2 in purchase list (r15542)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Show the cargo subtype in the vehicle details window (r15480)
- Change: The background of the the waypoint sign is now in the company colour (r15593)
- Change: Allow the default debug level of 6 for a dedicated server to be overridden by -d (if used after -D) (r15543)
- Change: [NewGRF] To decide whether a vehicle is refittable do not test its current capacity for being zero, but always use the 'capacity property' (r15541)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Almost infinite loop in garbage collection (r15659)
- Fix: Undeterministic file sorting when the date is equal for all files [FS#2716] (r15657)
- Fix: Changing vehicle.dynamic_engines when there are already vehicles can cause crashes (r15656, r15586)
- Fix: Only ever call any vehicle callbacks after the whole articulated engine has been built (except 0x16) (r15654)
- Fix: C++'s new (this) is seldom a good idea as destructors of member variables are not run causing memory leaks [FS#2706] (r15652)
- Fix: [OSX] Hack around an OSX stupidity in < 10.4 w.r.t. signals by not having any signal handling support for OSX < 10.4 (r15648)
- Fix: Add an EngineOverrideManager to give the term 'compatible NewGRF' again some sense and to not crash because of trivial changes [FS#2612] (r15645)
- Fix: Closing a network connection twice in the case that sending packets starts failing while disconnecting [FS#2710] (r15644)
- Fix: Game crashes when network pools are empty, so always allocate at least one pool block [FS#2712] (r15641)
- Fix: Do not allow more than 64 road vehicles to reserve a slot at a single road stop. 255 + 1 gives trouble, but 64 is even more than the road stop would be able to handle within the slot timeout time [FS#2707] (r15635)
- Fix: Kicking/banning a client from the Client list window crashed the server [FS#2705] (r15628)
- Fix: UTF8 string handling could cause buffer overruns [FS#2698] (r15626)
- Fix: When trying to reserve a self-crossing path the failed reservation was sometimes not cleared completely [FS#2701] (r15619)
- Fix: Towns would only build houses where the grid would not be, even when they are not allowed to build roads and the user 'implements' another layout [FS#2661] (r15604)
- Fix: Crash when using an extraordinarily large sprite as cursor [FS#2696] (r15601)
- Fix: Crash when opening viewport while scrolling the map and the mouse 'lands' on the window decoration of the viewport [FS#2695] (r15598)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Refit-info in purchase list did only check the first articulated part (r15592)
- Fix: Change owner of waypoints and deleted stations when merging companies or when a company bankrupts (r15588)
- Fix: Last activity time not properly updated causing downloads to be aborted after a minute [FS#2684] (r15580)
- Fix: Force unload not working when trying to force unload at the station where you received the cargo [FS#2680] (r15574)
- Fix: Theoretical buffer overflow when a company with too long name funded a road reconstruction (r15572)
- Fix: When building signals by dragging from a pre/entry/combo block signal, the signal you started at became a normal block signal [FS#2674] (r15567)
- Fix: Dependency information was not requested after the content state was reset causing the dependencies not always being selected (and thus downloaded) automatically [FS#2675] (r15565)
- Fix: Crash when saving a preset with unknown NewGRFs [FS#2646] (r15561)
- Fix: The font width cache was not updated when changing fonts causing the font spacing to be off when changing fonts in-game (auto font detection) (r15557)
- Fix: -v null crashing in 2051 due to trying to show the high score of the spectator (r15554)
- Fix: [NoAI] Crash when setting a depot order to the southern part of a ship depot [FS#2656] (r15551)
- Fix: The keep_all_autosave setting was ignored for dedicated servers/spectators [FS#2651] (r15546)
- Fix: If a buoy was placed directly in front of a dock, that dock was seen as a buoy and thus skipped once within 3 tiles [FS#2653] (r15545)
- Fix: Extracting downloaded content did not work for Windows if one uses a non-ASCII path [FS#2650] (r15544)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When articulated parts have no available default cargo, use the cargo type of the first part for livery selection [FS#2617] (r15541)
- Fix: Testing of 'only_this' in CmdRefitRoadVeh() could be skipped by 'continue' (r15540)
- Fix: [NewGRF] If an aircraft cannot carry any available cargo, it should not be available either instead of falling back to passenger/mail. Just like the other vehicle types also do (r15539)
- Fix: Do not allow special sprite characters (e.g. the ship sprite) as characters in input like filenames or text that is sent over the network (r15537)
- Fix: The local command queue did not get properly cleaned when leaving a game meaning you could end up executing commands of the previous network game [FS#2644] (r15529)
- Fix: Do not try to find the AIs the server runs when joining a multiplayer server (r15525)
- Fix: Use distance to closest station tile as estimate for YAPF too (NPF already does so). This makes it behave 'better' with wide stations [FS#2631] (r15518)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Wagonoverrides and articulated engine parts use the colour scheme of the engine, but not its recolour callback, nor its 2CC flag. Same applies to roadvehicles [FS#2642] (r15517)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Livery overrides for articulated parts of roadvehicles were not applied (r15516)
- Fix: Make the join/spectate command require to be connected to a network game; in SP it could lead to crashes (r15514)
- Fix: Generating a map with the original map generator with freeform edges on resulted in a crash [FS#2641] (r15511)
- Fix: Pre-0.5 OpenTTD stored new_nonstop and full_load_any in a different way, savegame conversion was not working for them (r15500)
- Fix: Crash when opening the game options when the currently loaded base graphics pack has less than 2 valid graphics files. For example when someone replaces all their original base graphics with custom work (but keeps the name) or renames the dos ones to windows or vice versa [FS#2630] (r15476)


0.7.0-beta1 (2009-02-16)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Make it possible to have multiple windows with edit box open simultaneously (r15424)
- Feature: Add ability to select which base graphics set is used from the Game Options window. The change takes effect when the window is closed. This option can only be used from the intro menu, as reloading graphics during a game may cause issues (r15389)
- Feature: Do not draw superfluous catenary wires [FS#1761] (r15347)
- Feature: Add option to group and subtotal expenses list in the company finance window (r15301)

- Feature: Allow terraforming of the tiles at the edges of the map (r15190)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Allow a grf to customise house name via callback 0x14D, during Tile Inquiry process (r15172)
- Feature: Downloading content from a central server (content.openttd.org) where authors can upload their NewGRFS/AI etc. This should make joining servers that use only NewGRFs that are distributed via this system easier as the players can download the NewGRFs from within the game. It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)
- Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)
- Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support var 0x45 (curvature info) also for road vehicles (r14945)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Automatically set last engine ageing year to the last 'introduction year plus half model life', to allow engines later than 2050 to appear (r14926)
- Feature: Distant joining of stations (r14919)
- Feature: Advanced setting to keep various building tools active, which are usually closed after placing an object (r14902)
- Feature: Remove the window limit, but leave a configurable limit on the number of non-sticky non-vital windows (r14899)
- Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)
- Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)
- Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [FS#1984] (r14827)
- Feature: Make the road grids of town match, when all are using the same road layout of course [FS#2390] (r14821)
- Feature: Pressing CTRL while dragging to build a bridge builds the last built bridge type if possible [FS#2238] (r14805)
- Feature: Make the date format for default savegame/screenshot names configurable (r14792)
- Feature: Allow scrolling with the left mouse button pressed (if enabled). Primarily useful for systems with touch screen (r14789)
- Feature: Allow up to 15 companies (r14735)
- Feature: Allow up to 255 clients in multiplayer games (r14730)
- Feature: When the chosen language is not supported by the current font, try to find a font that does and use that instead (r14618)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Action0Industries property 24 (industry supplies default name for nearby station) (r14598)
- Feature: Non-destructive autofill with option to keep waiting times [FS#1124] (r14592)
- Feature: Stop-in-depot order; after this order you have to manually start the vehicle again (or sell it) (r14524)
- Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)
- Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)
- Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)
- Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)
- Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)
- Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)
- Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as 'correct' and official graphics (r14197)
- Feature: Allow people to create their own base graphics easily and without requiring code changes (r14197)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for property 0x13 for Bridges. In other words, one can now specifies a 16 bits cost multiplier (r14172)
- Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)
- Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)
- Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it is done for other list_* console commands (r14041)
- Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)
- Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)
- Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)
- Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement var 63, variational action2 variable for Houses. Or, in more simple terms, the check for the animation frame of nearby house (r13519)
- Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add access to current long year and date from Action 7/9/D and VarAction2 (23/24 or A3/A4), and add access to (long format) building year, in Variational Action2 Variable 49 for Vehicles (r13376)
- Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and usable (r13339)
- Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)
- Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)
- Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town. The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's centre and how tolerant the town is (13226)
- Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)
- Feature: [NewGRF] The ability to play NewGRF sounds for industries and stations (r12817)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add some support for NewGRF station animation (r12798)
- Feature: Sorting vehicle lists by road vehicle/train length (r12766)
- Feature: Conditional 'skip/jump' orders (r12667)
- Feature: Ability to send a vehicle (using default orders) to the nearest depot (r12661)
- Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)
- Feature: Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces 'TTDP compatible order' setting (r12648)
- Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the 'full load any' patch setting (r12648)
- Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)
- Feature: Show what cargoes a station could be supplied with (r12596)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add random action 2 type 84. For vehicles only (r12452)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for var A2/22 for action 7/9/D: Difficulty level (r12449)
- Feature: Add +/- toggle buttons to station cargo waiting list to show/hide the detailed transferred cargo information (r12446)
- Feature: Open the time table when pressing the order button while pressing the CTRL key (r12441)
- Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [FS#1846] (r12425)
- Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [FS#1923] (r14958)
- Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)
- Change: When loading games in 'network' mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)
- Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargoes (r14683)
- Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)
- Fix: A town could build a statue under a bridge [FS#2618] (r15397)
- Fix: Multiple vehicles could be filling the timetable and only the data from one vehicle would be taken. Now only allow one to be filling at a time [FS#2466] (r15382)
- Fix: When testing for parallel road two tiles away, do not move more than one tile along the road (r15381)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The subcargo returned by vehicle variable 0x42 should be the most-common-subcargo of the most-common-cargo. If nothing is transported 0x..FFFF00 should be returned (r15378)
- Fix: A tram circling around in a depot did never actually 'enter' the depot [FS#2605] (r15375)
- Fix: Changing town road layout in-game caused ugly road networks [FS#2121] (r15340)
- Fix: Company could never have auto-assigned colour 0 (dark blue) (r15281)
- Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)
- Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [FS#2577] (r15256)
- Fix: Aircraft could be 'loading in the air' or have zero speed while in air after converting old savegames [FS#2571] (r15230, r15227)
- Fix: Tile error location not reset when levelling land causing a tile to be highlighted when there was nothing to flatten [FS#2542] (r15138)
- Fix: Signs with sign 'Sign' were lost when converting from TTD savegames (r15137)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Add support for 8 byte action7/9 data, used as a mask for GRFID checks (r15114)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Keep industry variables 8E and 8F in sync with 93, when changing production using results 0D, 0E or 0F of callback 29 or 35 (r15103)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)
- Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [FS#2508] (r14959)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [FS#1832] (r14956)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)
- Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [FS#1890] (r14954)
- Fix: The 'animation state' of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [FS#2512] (r14931)
- Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [FS#2500] (r14925)
- Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)
- Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)
- Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [FS#2495] (r14830)
- Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)
- Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the 'bankrupt' period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP. Now any company that is in MP or not 'currently controlled by the player' in SP will bankrupt [FS#1993] (r14750)
- Fix: Do not let any disaster vehicle (Helicopter or Airplane) target invalid industry (r14746)
- Fix: Memory leak in Action 0x0F (new town names) (r14737)
- Fix: Writing a single char to the config file caused reading outside a buffer (r14729)
- Fix: First transfer the whole load of a vehicle chain to industries before triggering any processing. This reduces callback usage and resolves critical rounding errors when using input-cargo-multipliers instead of production callbacks [FS#2460] (r14705)
- Fix: Zeppeliner (disaster) should target st->airport_tile, not st->xy (r14694)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Gradual filling graphics were not chosen according to the NewGRF spec [FS#2435] (r14678)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Check sprite size when executing action 6 (r14674)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Property 7 and callback 12 were broken for aircraft. Now callback 12 is properly called also for 'mail'. If the callback is not used, 'mail' uses 1/4 of property 7 (rounded up) [FS#2444] (r14672)
- Fix: Possible stack corruption when reading corrupted sprites [FS#2415] (r14610)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Return the current year as construction year for unfinished houses (r14608)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When callback 1E fails, use the standard random colour (r14605)
- Fix: The company ID is off-by-one with respect to the rest of the GUI in the cheat window [FS#2422] (r14603)
- Fix: The range for kicking/banning clients is based on the maximum number of clients, not the maximum number of companies [FS#2414] (r14588)
- Fix: Allow capacity callbacks (15, 36) to return zero capacity (r14578)
- Fix: Crashes when a NewGRF sends an invalid string [FS#2395] (r14563)
- Fix: Order pool seemed to look full when it was not as it only checked whether it was possible to allocate a new block of pool items instead of checking for free pool items (r14547)
- Fix: Do not deliver cargo to industries not inside station catchment area [FS#2138] (r14530)
- Fix: Allocate stub (empty) sound entries when loading an empty/corrupt/incorrectly sized sample.cat instead of making valid NewGRFs fail to load (r14527)
- Fix: Make sure trains stop at the end of a station; a 3/8th length train did stop 2/8th of its length too early causing a 63/8th long train not to fit in a 4 tile station [FS#2379] (r14526)
- Fix: Small possible chance of desync due to sorting on pointer instead of by (station) index [FS#2348] (r14463)
- Fix: When a road stop gets moved make sure to update the destination of RVs going to that road stop [FS#2330] (r14446)
- Fix: Support for spaces in directories passed to ./configure [FS#1802] (r14440)
- Fix: Trains would sometimes move one time too often/little when moving from diagonal<->non-diagonal tracks [FS#1793] (r14436)
- Fix: Balance the monthly random industry changes, by introducing a daily random industry change [FS#1885] (r14332)
- Fix: Save the palette of the loaded NewGRFs in the savegame, so joining with a server using Windows palette will make a client with the DOS palette do palette conversion and (thus) not cause a desync (r14233)
- Fix: Glitches (alignment issues/inconsistent vehicle graphics) in original graphics (r14214, r14211)
- Fix: One could not get a list of vehicles sharing an order when the number of orders was 0; you could see that the vehicles had a shared order though [FS#2085] (r14097)
- Fix: Various assorted autoreplace issues/misbehaviours [FS#1264, FS#2037, FS#2038, FS#2110] (r14083)
- Fix: The autoreplace gui showed vehicle types for replacement which CmdSetAutoReplace() did not accept (r14037)
- Fix: Automatically recalculate inflation if NewGRFs are changed and cargo types are added, so that cargo payment rates are correct [FS#2074] (r13836)


0.6.3 (2008-10-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: NewGRF VarAction 2 variable 43 for industries saw MP_VOID tiles as land tiles and was inefficient (r14417, r14416, r14415)
- Fix: Possible buffer overrun/wrong parameter type passed to printf (r14414, r14397)
- Fix: Generation seed set using -G was always overwritten by -g (r14408)
- Fix: Do not allow extending signals by dragging in any direction other than the track direction [FS#2202] (r14013)

- Fix: NewGRF rail continuation would always mark a tunnel on the same axis as connected, even when the tunnel faces the wrong direction (r13734)
- Fix: Assumption that non-north tiles of a house do not have the 1x1 building bit set was flawed with some NewGRFs. This caused the amount of houses to differ, which causes the town radii to differ, which causes desyncs when towns are expanded (r13729)
- Fix: Possible desync on the autorenew settings 20+ game years (i.e. 4.5+ hours) after a company was started (r13718)
- Fix: Any player could construct new companies [FS#2144] (r13716)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Possible buffer overflow in string truncation code [CVE-2008-3576] (r13700)
- Fix: Handle SETX(Y) properly when truncating a string instead of ignoring it and returning a too long string (r13699)

- Fix: Make sure a command is ran in the context of autoreplace or not (r13691)
- Fix: In the case that elrails and 'realistic' acceleration are disabled all electrified engines would have no power on load, until the vehicle got turned around, loaded or got into a depot [FS#2102]- Fix: Saving TTD imported games in recession failed due to wrong (and unneeded) type conversions in the saveload code [FS#2131] (r13679)
- Fix: Inactive companies from old (TTD) saves could be marked active in some cases, which then loads garbage in their statistics and such [FS#2126] (r13676)

- Fix: Only the front of a RV would be considered when determining to what cargoes a vehicle can be refitted instead of all cargoes [FS#2109] (r13622)
- Fix: If the first bridge can not be build for a given length, then none of the other bridges can. Effectively meaning that if someone replaces the first bridge with a bridge that can be only 3 tiles longs then only other bridges that can be 3 tiles long will be buildable, but only if they are 3 tiles long [FS#2100] (r13611)
- Fix: Signal states could be propagated through waypoints built in orthogonal axis (r13589)
- Fix: [OSX] 10.5 failed to switch to fullscreen (r13584)
- Fix: RVs continuing onto next DT station when they are build adjacent to them [FS#2040] (r13581)
- Fix: Disable static NewGRFs when non-static NewGRFs query them in the context of network games. This makes it impossible for static NewGRFs to disable non-static NewGRFs and 'bad' things happening because the non-static NewGRF does not know about the static NewGRF (r13576)
- Fix: Properly count number of non-north housetiles [FS#2083] (r13518)
- Fix: Incorrect usage of strtoul (r13508)
- Fix: Clear the memory for the new AI during the loading of a savegame so it does not try to execute commands generated in a different savegame, which could be resulting in the AI trying to give orders to stations that do not exist (r13505)
- Fix: Drawing of zoomed out partial sprites could cause deadlocks or crashes (r13502)
- Fix: First determine where to *exactly* build a house before asking a NewGRF whether the location is good instead of possibly moving the house a tile after the NewGRF said the location is good (r13489)
- Fix: Track was not removed on company bankruptcy when there was a ship on lower halftile (r13488)
- Fix: Let ships also navigate on half-tile sloped watery rail tiles (r13485)

- Fix: Do not crash when resolving vehicle sprite groups with zero sprites (r13397)
- Fix: In the purchase list, CB36 for capacity was not called for the first part of rail and road vehicles (r13385)
- Fix: Loading of very old OpenTTD savegames was broken (r13373)

- Fix: Minor errors related to industries accepted/produced cargo (r12933)
- Fix: Town rating was affected even after the test run (r12920)
- Fix: Flood road tiles even when there are road works in progress [FS#1965] (r12919)
- Fix: Do not initialise Station struct with tile=0, buoys will never change that value [FS#1960] (r12915)
- Fix: Game crash when a spectator/server tried to show an engine with no owner when a NewGRF requested a specific variable (r12914)
- Fix: Report reverse sprite status (FD/FE) to NewGRF for manually toggled vehicles (r12910)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Vehicle groups, engine replacement rules and player/company names were not properly reset/freed after bankrupt (r12906)
- Fix: Remove trams from savegames saved in OpenTTD without tram support, it is better than to simply crash [FS#1953] (r12904)
- Fix: GCC on FreeBSD does not support -dumpmachine causing configure to fail. Use g++ instead [FS#1928] (r12876)

- Fix: Use YAPF for fairly old savegames from before YAPF was introduced (r12845)
- Fix: The industry tick trigger should only be triggered once every 256 ticks, not every tick... Also bail out of the triggers a little earlier if you know they are not going to happen anyway (r12844)

- Fix: Possible out of bounds array access (r12809)
- Fix: Enforce autorenew values range in command (r12808)
- Fix: Vehicles could break down during loading and keep loading. The intention of the break down code is not to break down when having zero speed, therefore break downs now do not happen when loading [FS#1938] (r12795)
- Fix: [OSX] In some rare cases when using an uncalibrated monitor the system colour space could not be retrieved. Show an error when this happens instead of just trying an assertion (r12776)

- Fix: Removing road pieces from a town gave you twice the intended penalty [FS#1920] (r12682)
- Fix: When a road vehicle has a tram only stop multiple times in a row in its orders, only the first one would be skipped [FS#1918] (r12678)
- Fix: Colour remaps on station sprites only worked for company colours [FS#1902] (r12674)

- Feature: Add the possibility of automatically filling in timetables based on the times from the first (or subsequent) run-throughs (r10331)
- Feature: Option to select the 'default' rail type when you start a new game or load a game. This is done either static, i.e. rail, electrified rail, monorail and maglev, or dynamic which takes either the first or last available railtype or the railtype that is used most on the map [FS#812] (r10329)
- Feature: Give a better explanation why the loading of a savegame failed and do not crash on loading savegames that were altered by patches or branches [FS#917] (r10300)

- Feature: Advanced vehicle lists a.k.a. group interface. Now you can make groups of vehicles and perform all kinds of tasks on that given group (r9874)
- Feature: Make 'improved loading' a proper improved loading instead of loading one (semi-)random vehicle at a time. Furthermore fill multiple vehicles at once when there is enough cargo to do so (r9838)
- Feature: Add drag and drop removal of station tiles (r9810)
- Feature: Support for 'curvature info', Action 2 for train, variable 45 (r9803)

- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for newhouses (r9315)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)
- Feature: Translation dependent formatting of dates (r8906)
- Feature: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)
- Feature: Stop loading and disable the current NewGRF if a fatal error message in Action B is encountered. Also be more strict on the values accepted (r8830)

- Feature: Increase sprite limit from 16384 sprites to 16777216 sprites (r8128, r8129)
- Feature: Add the ability to load savegames when you do not have the exact GRF files in your list. GRF files that are found based on GRF ID (but not on matching md5sum) are used instead of disabling them. This does not affect MP games, there you still need an exact match (r8106)

- Feature: Add support for tractive effort to 'realistic' acceleration (r7592)
- Feature: Allow to build bridges of arbitrary rail/road combinations (including signals) (r7573)
- Codechange: Do not allow configuration changes, that NewGRFs can directly use to change their behaviour, during network games as this can cause desyncs (r11452)
- Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)
- Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
- Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
- Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
- Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
- Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)
- Codechange: Do not redraw all station tiles when cargo is added or removed if the station has no custom graphics (r10062)
- Codechange: Add some support for NewGRF var 7D, temporary storage array (r9707)

- Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
- Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
- Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)
- Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)
- Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)
- Fix: Properly support genders coming from NewGRFs instead of crashing [FS#1430] (r11422)
- Fix: Do not ignore the autorenew settings for new games when creating a new game [FS#1428] (r11415)
- Fix: Do not do a 270 degree turn when 90 degrees is enough on a commuter airport [FS#1422] (r11408)
- Fix: In rare cases OpenTTD could segfault when resizing and scroll the main window (r11405)
- Fix: Manually replacing a vehicle with shared orders makes it lose it is order index and service interval [FS1384] (r11370)
- Fix: Road vehicles must not drive through each other on bridges/in tunnels [FS#1258] (r11366)

- Fix: Cloning vehicles with non-standard sub-cargotypes (i.e. livery refits) failed [FS#1380] (r11362)
- Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)
- Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)
- Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)
- Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)
- Fix: One could sell vehicles that were crashed in a depot, which would still yield money/one could construct trains of crashed vehicles [FS#1307, FS#1228] (r11229, r11230)
- Fix: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail [FS#1260] (r11167)
- Fix: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)
- Fix: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown [FS#553] (r11064)
- Fix: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) [FS#1182] (r11059)
- Fix: Crash when having the Finance window opened of the player you are cheating to [FS#1177] (r11028)
- Fix: Switching players (using the cheat) crashed on Big Endian machines [FS#1150] (r11023)
- Fix: The canal border determination did not take oil rigs into consideration (r11022)
- Fix: Do not display income/expenses when they do not belong to a 'valid' tile, like the money cheat/giving money [FS#1175] (r11021)
- Fix: One could not give money when they had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative [FS#1174] (r11020)
- Fix: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location [FS#1104] (r10792)
- Fix: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) [FS#1058] (r10686)
- Fix: Graphical glitches when the 'link landscape toolbar' patch is turned on when opening one of the construction toolbars [FS#1076] (r10685)
- Fix: Trolly AI did not know about steep slopes, and used wrong tileh in some cases [FS#1070] (r10655)
- Fix: Be consistent with the space between the company name and the player number, i.e. always put a space between them [FS#1052] (r10627)
- Fix: [YAPF] Ships received curve penalty for non-diagonal straight move (r10578)
- Fix: Do not segfault when you quit in the end-of-the-game screen [FS#1020] (r10548)
- Fix: When Cheat-Window is open and a new month happens, the window was not redrawn instantly (r10547)
- Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)
- Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)
- Fix: Error dialogue was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)
- Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)
- Fix: When landscape generating, allow for 200ms between screen updates instead of updating every 200ms. Previously slow screen updates would result in very slow map generation (r10396)
- Fix: One could only build a limited number of stations before one had to rename them [FS#278] (r10320)
- Fix: Acceleration not calculated properly when a train goes up a hill between tunnels [FS#786] (r10317)
- Fix: [YAPF] Now it is no longer needed to invalidate the YAPF segment cache every tick in MP (read performance increase). Segment cost now does not contain the curves between segments. As a result the cache should be now accurate (r10302)
- Fix: [YAPF] Assertion triggered in some special cases [FS#901] (r10301)
- Fix: Flush stdout on dedicated server output to ensure an update of stdout [FS#775] (r10295)
- Fix: With smooth_economy, when industry production hit 32, it stayed there for ever. Give it some chance to get out of that uber-lowness (although it is a very slim chance, at least it has one) (r10290)
- Fix: Also age engines that are not front-engines [FS#202] (r10288)
- Fix: Money overflow bugs in many locations [FS#723] (r10212)

- Fix: A vehicle without visual effects is not per definition unpowered (r9802)
- Fix: Do not assume that trains running on monorail/maglev cannot smoke/spark (r9801)
- Fix: Play sound effects based on the engine class, not the rail type (r9800)
- Fix: Separate engine class and engine running cost class (r9799)
- Fix: Clone vehicles will no longer refit for free (r9689)
- Fix: Improved loading does not use a huge amount of processing power anymore when having a lot of trains [FS#423] (r9683)
- Fix: Truncate the NewGRF information text in the NewGRF GUI if it is too long (r9449)
- Fix: Cancel in password queries reduces amount of players in the network game when they have not joined the game yet [FS#688] (r9378)
- Fix: If all news-setting buttons show 'full', make the ALL-button show 'full' too (r9137)
- Fix: Open and close messages now have their own setting, so you can hide economy changes, but do show open/close of industries [FS#525] (r9097)
- Fix: Do not make owner signs transparent, as then you loose the information who it owns [FS#637] (r9067)
- Fix: Store the owner of a statue, so when it gets removed, the town is notified of it [FS#638] (r9066)
- Fix: Inactive connections are not automatically kicked, i.e. people who only open a telnet (or similar) connection to a server [FS#115] (r9038)
- Fix: Do not select a disabled platform length/number of track count when going out of drag-drop mode [FS#450] (r8999)
- Fix: Make an aircraft at 400 km/h go as fast as a train at 400 km/h (r8973)
- Fix: You were unable to build roads in the scenario editor when there is no town 0, even though there are other towns (r8608)
- Fix: Road Vehicles now can obtain a slot even if the station is very spread out [FS#577] (r8536)
- Fix: Allow lumber mill to cut trees only when they are full grown (r8535)
- Fix: Segmentation fault when the toolbar gets removed and you have selected one of the items in a sub menu of the toolbar (r8533)
- Fix: Remove phantom oil rigs sometimes present in old savegames (r8485)
- Fix: When a station is removed, vehicles do not get excessive payment any longer, as the origin TILE is now stored as long as the origin STATION for the transported cargos (r8144)
- Fix: The game could crash when the chat key (<ENTER>) is pressed too vehemently during the join of the game. Your client's id does not exist in the clients list yet, and returns NULL (r8132)
- Fix: Rail vehicles can no longer enter tunnels or bridgeheads with wrong railtype (r7976)
- Fix: When path finding onto a bridge or tunnel end from previous tile (but not warping from the opposite end) check the enter direction. This fixes signal setting if a rail ends on the top of a tunnel end (r7718)
- Fix: When following path for signals, do not skip back to the previous tile, as for tunnels and bridge ends the entering direction is wrong (r7717)
- Fix: [YAPF] Suppress 'Train is lost' message if path finding ended on the first two-way red signal due to YAPF.rail_firstred_twoway_eol option (r7628)
- Fix: [OPF] Signal update was incorrectly propagated (r7620)

- Fix: Make the AI not crash when it has ships as the AI does not support them [FS#1133] (r10942)
- Fix: Trains would not get flooded when they are at the lower part of a tile that would become a coast tile after flooding [FS#1127] (r10892)
- Fix: Removing road with the road removal tool would also work with a negative bank account, making the bank account even more negative than it was [FS#1125] (r10890)
- Fix: Some isocodes were wrong, resulting in some NewGRF not working properly for the affected languages (r10877)
- Fix: [Windows] Do not try to minimise or restore the window when closing OpenTTD [FS#998] (r10835)
- Fix: Trains going over bridges would get the 'going down hill' accelerate bonus, which causes trains to go faster on bridges than they would be going on level land [FS#1096] (r10739)
- Fix: Trains being split into two pieces when loading an old savegame [FS#1062] (r10735)
- Fix: [OS/2] Fix chdir problem with open/save dialogue (r10650)

- Fix: One cannot navigate using arrow keys in the game name text box [FS#1038] (r10500)
- Fix: Ship's maximum speed wrongly shown [FS#1013] (r10497)
- Fix: [OSX] Of the resolution is changed to something that is too high for the monitor, then it is reduced to fit the monitor size, solving several crashes and graphical glitches [FS#458] (r10410)
- Fix: NPF was leaking memory each time it got initialised, except for the first time (r10357)
- Fix: [YAPF] 'target_seen' flag that is set prematurely in some cases (1 tile long cached segment followed by target station) which caused asserts to trigger [FS#884] (r10199)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Make the client list window (for network games) stickyable (r10293)
- Feature: Console command to get the current game date (r10137)
- Fix: Waypoints could be renamed when you are not the owner (r10368)
- Fix: Smooth economy did not close primary industries and it allowed increasing of production of industries that should not have rising productions (r10348, r10347, r10290)
- Fix: Acceleration for trains on slopes is not calculated properly [FS#786] (r10344, r10317)
- Fix: The 'old' pathfinders (OPF and NPF) for road vehicles could not find a path when in a tunnel [FS#290] (r10345)
- Fix: Only add the autoreplace menu when autoreplace actually knows about the group [FS#880] (r10337)
- Fix: Signal state sometimes not properly set when the signal 'pathfinder' reached the end of a line [FS#910] (r10336)
- Fix: News messages were shown over the endgame/highscore windows [FS#943] (r10333)
- Fix: Rail could be destroyed when building tunnels (r10306)
- Fix: Flush the output of the dedicated server console (r10295)
- Fix: The 'pause' key did not work in the scenario editor (r10294)
- Fix: Age non-front engines too (so when you move engines around in the depot they do not get age 0 when they are much older [FS#202] (r10288)
- Fix: Do not make everyone spectator if 1 joining client failed to create new company (r10284)
- Fix: Remove invalid characters (for the file system) from savegame names [FS#916, FS#850] (r10272, r10116)
- Fix: Some old savegames could have the wrong bits unset (r10268, r10147)
- Fix: Do not look in every direction for tunnels when building one, one direction is enough (r10258)
- Fix: [Windows] Do not mess desktop when using ALT-TAB [FS#876] (r10251, r10186)
- Fix: Take the age of the front vehicle for station rating (r10246)
- Fix: Terraforming wipes out canals. Now you always have to remove the canal before terraforming, instead of 'just' removing the canal [FS#594] (r10240)
- Fix: Only 2 trains could crash at one time as collision checking stopped on the first hit. This could technically cause desyncs in network games as the collision hash order is not guaranteed [FS#892] (r10222)
- Fix: Land under foundations was terraform when it should not be terraformed [FS#882, FS#890] (r10219)
- Fix: Do not make a 270 degree turn on the international airport when a 90 degree turn is enough (r10187)
- Fix: Crash when trying to get the aircraft movement state of an aircraft going to a just deleted airport [FS#874] (r10165)

- Fix: When you got a sufficiently small resolution, there is a possibility for a division by zero when a sound is played (r10138)
- Fix: When removing a dock, a ship will always try to reach the old location of the dock even when it cannot anymore because it the old location of the dock is now land instead of water [FS#810] (r10131)
- Fix: SetCurrentGrfLangID returned the wrong language ids for most languages (r10130)
- Fix: Some NewGRFs use the same (unused in the 'current' climate) sprite IDs. Normally this gives some artifacts, but when one NewGRF expects it to be a sprite and another NewGRF overwrites it with a non-sprite nasty things happen (drawing a non-sprite crashes OpenTTD) [FS#838] (r10109)
- Fix: Multiple subsequent 'give money' actions could result in duplicate messages that money has been transferred when it only happened once, or tell you paid money when you did not [FS#834, FS#839] (r10087, r10085)
- Fix: 'Deactivate Electrified Railways' did not work [FS#836] (10083)
- Fix: Memory leaks in the networking code [FS#846, FS#844] (r10082, r10075)
- Fix: Coverage area highlight was still show when it was turned off for docks [FS#835] (r10068)
- Fix: Do not use override engine type for articulated wagon parts (r10048)
- Fix: Sprite resulting from '?' substitution was reloaded into the cache entry for SPR_IMG_QUERY instead of the original sprite cache entry. This resulted in unaccounted missing sprite cache memory, and was exacerbated because the original missing sprite was not cached, so it did it again and again and again. Slowdowns and boom (r10038)

## 1.0) Preface

  The admin network provides a dedicated network protocol designed for other
  applications to communicate with OpenTTD. Connected applications can execute
  console commands remotely (rcon commands) with no further authentication.
  Furthermore information about clients and companies can be provided.

  Admin applications remain connected when starting a new game or loading a saved
  game in contrast to normal OpenTTD clients that get disconnected.

  This document describes the admin network and its protocol.

  Please refer to the mentioned enums in `src/network/core/tcp_admin.h`

  Please also note that further improvements to the admin protocol can mean that
  more packet types will be sent by the server. For forward compatibility it is
  therefore wise to ignore unknown packets. Future improvements might also add
  additional data to packets. This data should be ignored. Data will never be
  removed from packets in later versions, except the possibility that complete
  packets are dropped in favour of a new packet.

  This though will be reflected in the protocol version as announced in the
  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_PROTOCOL` in section 2.0).

  A reference implementation in Java for a client connecting to the admin interface
  can be found at: [http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/joan](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/joan)


## 2.0) Joining the network

  Create a TCP connection to the server on port 3977. The application is
  expected to authenticate within 10 seconds.

  To authenticate send a `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_JOIN` packet.

  The server will reply with `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_PROTOCOL` followed directly by
  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME`.

  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_PROTOCOL` contains details about the protocol version.
  It is the job of your application to check this number and decide whether
  it will remain connected or not.
  Furthermore, this packet holds details on every `AdminUpdateType` and the
  supported `AdminFrequencyTypes` (bitwise representation).

  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME` contains details on the server and the map,
  e.g. if the server is dedicated, its NetworkLanguage, size of the Map, etc.

  Once you have received `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME` you are connected and
  authorized to do your thing.

  The server will not provide any game related updates unless you ask for them.
  There are four packets the server will none the less send, if applicable:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_ERROR
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_NEWGAME
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_SHUTDOWN

  However, `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME` only after a `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_NEWGAME`


## 3.0) Asking for updates

  Asking for updates is done with `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_UPDATE_FREQUENCY`.
  With this packet you define which update you wish to receive at which
  frequency.

  Note: not every update type supports every frequency. If in doubt, you can
  verify against the data received in `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_PROTOCOL`.

  Please note the potential gotcha in the "Certain packet information" section below
  when using the `ADMIN_UPDATE_FREQUENCY` packet.

  The server will not confirm your registered update. However, asking for an
  invalid `AdminUpdateType` or a not supported `AdminUpdateFrequency` you will be
  disconnected from the server with `NETWORK_ERROR_ILLEGAL_PACKET`.

  Additional debug information can be found with a debug level of `net=3`.

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_DATE` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_DATE

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CLIENT_INFO` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_JOIN
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_INFO
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_UPDATE
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_QUIT
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_ERROR

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_INFO` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_NEW
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_INFO
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_UPDATE
    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_REMOVE

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_ECONOMY` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_ECONOMY

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_STATS` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_STATS

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CHAT` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CHAT

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CONSOLE` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CONSOLE


  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CMD_LOGGING` results in the server sending:

    - ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CMD_LOGGING

## 3.1) Polling manually

  Certain `AdminUpdateTypes` can also be polled:

    - ADMIN_UPDATE_DATE
    - ADMIN_UPDATE_CLIENT_INFO
    - ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_INFO
    - ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_ECONOMY
    - ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_STATS
    - ADMIN_UPDATE_CMD_NAMES

  Please note the potential gotcha in the "Certain packet information" section below
  when using the `ADMIN_POLL` packet.

  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CLIENT_INFO` and `ADMIN_UPDATE_COMPANY_INFO` accept an additional
  parameter. This parameter is used to specify a certain client or company.
  Setting this parameter to `UINT32_MAX (0xFFFFFFFF)` will tell the server you
  want to receive updates for all clients or companies.

  Not supported `AdminUpdateType` in the poll will result in the server
  disconnecting the application with `NETWORK_ERROR_ILLEGAL_PACKET`.

  Additional debug information can be found with a debug level of `net=3`.


## 4.0) Sending rcon commands

  Rcon runs separate from the `ADMIN_UPDATE_CONSOLE` `AdminUpdateType`. Requesting
  the execution of a remote console command is done with the packet
  `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_RCON`.

  Note: No additional authentication is required for rcon commands.

  The server will reply with one or more `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_RCON` packets.
  Finally an `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_RCON_END` packet will be sent. Applications
  will not receive the answer twice if they have asked for the `AdminUpdateType`
  `ADMIN_UPDATE_CONSOLE`, as the result is not printed on the servers console
  (just like clients rcon commands).

  Furthermore, sending a `say` command (or any similar command) will not
  be sent back into the admin network.
  Chat from the server itself will only be sent to the admin network when it
  was not sent from the admin network.

  Note that when content is queried or updated via rcon, the processing
  happens asynchronously. But the `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_RCON_END` packet is sent
  already right after the content is requested as there's no immediate output.
  Thus other packages and the output of content rcon command may be sent at
  an arbitrary later time, mixing into the output of other console activity,
  e.g. also of possible subsequent other rcon commands sent.


## 5.0) Sending chat

  Sending a `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_CHAT` results in chat originating from the server.

  Currently four types of chat are supported:

    - NETWORK_ACTION_CHAT
    - NETWORK_ACTION_CHAT_CLIENT
    - NETWORK_ACTION_CHAT_COMPANY
    - NETWORK_ACTION_SERVER_MESSAGE

  `NETWORK_ACTION_SERVER_MESSAGE` can be sent to a single client or company
  using the respective `DestType` and ID.
  This is a message prefixed with the 3 stars, e.g. `*** foo has joined the game`

## 5.1) Receiving chat

  Register `ADMIN_UPDATE_CHAT` at `ADMIN_FREQUENCY_AUTOMATIC` to receive chat.
  The application will be able to receive all chat the server can see.

  The configuration option `network.server_admin_chat` specifies whether
  private chat for to the server is distributed into the admin network.


## 6.0) Disconnecting

  It is a kind thing to say good bye before leaving. Do this by sending the
  `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_QUIT` packet.


## 7.0) Certain packet information

  `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_UPDATE_FREQUENCY` and `ADMIN_PACKET_ADMIN_POLL`

    Potential gotcha: the AdminUpdateType integer type used is a
    uint16 for `UPDATE_FREQUENCY`, and a uint8 for `POLL`.
    This is due to boring legacy reasons.
    It is safe to cast between the two when sending
    (i.e cast from a uint8 to a uint16).

  All `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_*` packets have an enum value greater 100.

  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_WELCOME`

    Either directly follows `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_PROTOCOL` or is sent
    after a new game has been started or a map loaded, i.e. also
    after ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_NEWGAME.

  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CLIENT_JOIN` and `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_COMPANY_NEW`

    These packets directly follow their respective INFO packets. If you receive
    a CLIENT_JOIN / COMPANY_NEW packet without having received the INFO packet
    it may be a good idea to POLL for the specific ID.

  `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CMD_NAMES` and `ADMIN_PACKET_SERVER_CMD_LOGGING`

    Data provided with these packets is not stable and will not be
    treated as such. Do not rely on IDs or names to be constant
    across different versions / revisions of OpenTTD.
    Data provided in this packet is for logging purposes only.
# Debugging / reporting desyncs

As desyncs are hard to make reproducible OpenTTD has the ability to log all
actions done by clients so we can replay the whole game in an effort to make
desyncs better reproducible. You need to turn this ability on. When turned
on an automatic savegame will be made once the map has been constructed in
the 'save/autosave' directory, see OpenTTD directories to know where to find
this directory. Furthermore the log file 'commands-out.log' will be created
and all actions will be written to there.

To enable the desync debugging you need to set the debug level for 'desync'
to at least 1. You do this by starting OpenTTD with '`-d desync=<level>`' as
parameter or by typing '`debug_level desync=<level>`' in OpenTTD's internal
console.
The desync debug levels are:

- 0: nothing.
- 1: dumping of commands to 'commands-out.log'.
- 2: same as 1 plus checking vehicle caches and dumping that too.
- 3: same as 2 plus monthly saves in autosave.
- 4 and higher: same as 3

Restarting OpenTTD will overwrite 'commands-out.log'. OpenTTD will not remove
the savegames (dmp_cmds_*.sav) made by the desync debugging system, so you
have to occasionally remove them yourself!

The naming format of the desync savegames is as follows:
dmp_cmds_XXXXXXXX_YYYYYYYY.sav. The XXXXXXXX is the hexadecimal representation
of the generation seed of the game and YYYYYYYY is the hexadecimal
representation of the date of the game. This sorts the savegames by game and
then by date making it easier to find the right savegames.

When a desync has occurred with the desync debugging turned on you should file
a bug report with the following files attached:

- commands-out.log as it contains all the commands that were done
- the last saved savegame (search for the last line beginning with
   'save: dmp_cmds_' in commands-out.log). We use this savegame to check
   whether we can quickly reproduce the desync. Otherwise we will need …
- the first saved savegame (search for the first line beginning with 'save'
   where the first part, up to the last underscore '_', is the same). We need
   this savegame to be able to reproduce the bug when the last savegame is not
   old enough. If you loaded a scenario or savegame you need to attach that.
- optionally you can attach the savegames from around 50%, 75%, 85%, 90% and
   95% of the game's progression. We can use these savegames to speed up the
   reproduction of the desync, but we should be able to reproduce these
   savegames based on the first savegame and commands-out.log.
- in case you use any NewGRFs you should attach the ones you used unless
   we can easily find them ourselves via bananas or when they are in the
   #openttdcoop pack.

Do NOT remove the dmp_cmds savegames of a desync you have reported until the
desync has been fixed; if you, by accident, send us the wrong savegames we
will not be able to reproduce the desync and thus will be unable to fix it.

## More information

You can find more theory on the causes and debugging of desyncs in the
[desync documentation](./desync.md).

## 1.1) OpenTTD multiplayer architecture

  OpenTTD has a huge gamestate, which changes all of the time.
  The savegame contains the complete gamestate at a specific point
  in time. But this state changes completely each tick: Vehicles move
  and trees grow.

  However, most of these changes in the gamestate are deterministic:
  Without a player interfering a vehicle follows its orders always
  in the same way, and trees always grow the same.

  In OpenTTD multiplayer synchronisation works by creating a savegame
  when clients join, and then transferring that savegame to the client,
  so it has the complete gamestate at a fixed point in time.

  Afterwards clients only receive 'commands', that is: Stuff which is
  not predictable, like
   - player actions
   - AI actions
   - GameScript actions
   - Admin Port command
   - rcon commands
   - ...

  These commands contain the information on how to execute the command,
  and when to execute it. Time is measured in 'network frames'.
  Mind that network frames to not match ingame time. Network frames
  also run while the game is paused, to give a defined behaviour to
  stuff that is executing while the game is paused.

  The deterministic part of the gamestate is run by the clients on
  their own. All they get from the server is the instruction to
  run the gamestate up to a certain network time, which basically
  says that there are no commands scheduled in that time.

  When a client (which includes the server itself) wants to execute
  a command (i.e. a non-predictable action), it does this by
   - calling DoCommandP resp. DoCommandPInternal
   - These functions first do a local test-run of the command to
     check simple preconditions. (Just to give the client an
     immediate response without bothering the server and waiting for
     the response.) The test-run may not actually change the
     gamestate, all changes must be discarded.
   - If the local test-run succeeds the command is sent to the server.
   - The server inserts the command into the command queue, which
     assigns a network frame to the commands, i.e. when it shall be
     executed on all clients.
   - Enhanced with this specific timestamp, the command is send to all
     clients, which execute the command simultaneously in the same
     network frame in the same order.

## 1.2) What is a Desync and how is it detected

  In the ideal case all clients have the same gamestate as the server
  and run in sync. That is, vehicle movement is the same on all
  clients, and commands are executed the same everywhere and
  have the same results.

  When a Desync happens, it means that the gamestates on the clients
  (including the server) are no longer the same. Just imagine
  that a vehicle picks the left line instead of the right line at
  a junction on one client.

  The important thing here is, that no one notices when a Desync
  occurs. The desync client will continue to simulate the gamestate
  and execute commands from the server. Once the gamestate differs
  it will increasingly spiral out of control: If a vehicle picks a
  different route, it will arrive at a different time at a station,
  which will load different cargo, which causes other vehicles to
  load other stuff, which causes industries to notice different
  servicing, which causes industries to change production, ...
  the client could run all day in a different universe.

  To limit how long a Desync can remain unnoticed, the server
  transfers some checksums every now and then for the gamestate.
  Currently this checksum is the state of the random number
  generator of the game logic. A lot of things in OpenTTD depend
  on the RNG, and if the gamestate differs, it is likely that the
  RNG is called at different times, and the state differs when
  checked.

  The clients compare this 'checksum' with the checksum of their
  own gamestate at the specific network frame. If they differ,
  the client disconnects with a Desync error.

  The important thing here is: The detection of the Desync is
  only an ultimate failure detection. It does not give any
  indication on when the Desync happened. The Desync may after
  all have occurred long ago, and just did not affect the checksum
  up to now. The checksum may have matched 10 times or more
  since the Desync happened, and only now the Desync has spiraled
  enough to finally affect the checksum. (There was once a desync
  which was only noticed by the checksum after 20 game years.)

## 1.3) Typical causes of Desyncs

  Desyncs can be caused by the following scenarios:
   - The savegame does not describe the complete gamestate.
      - Some information which affects the progression of the
        gamestate is not saved in the savegame.
      - Some information which affects the progression of the
        gamestate is not loaded from the savegame.
        This includes the case that something is not completely
        reset before loading the savegame, so data from the
        previous game is carried over to the new one.
   - The gamestate does not behave deterministic.
      - Cache mismatch: The game logic depends on some cached
        values, which are not invalidated properly. This is
        the usual case for NewGRF-specific Desyncs.
      - Undefined behaviour: The game logic performs multiple
        things in an undefined order or with an undefined
        result. E.g. when sorting something with a key while
        some keys are equal. Or some computation that depends
        on the CPU architecture (32/64 bit, little/big endian).
   - The gamestate is modified when it shall not be modified.
      - The test-run of a command alters the gamestate.
      - The gamestate is altered by a player or script without
        using commands.


## 2.1) Cache debugging

  Desyncs which are caused by improper cache validation can
  often be found by enabling cache validation:
   - Start OpenTTD with '-d desync=2'.
   - This will enable validation of caches every tick.
     That is, cached values are recomputed every tick and compared
     to the cached value.
   - Differences are logged to 'commands-out.log' in the autosave
     folder.

  Mind that this type of debugging can also be done in singleplayer.

## 2.2) Desync recording

  If you have a server, which happens to encounter Desyncs often,
  you can enable recording of the gamestate alterations. This
  will later allow the replay the gamestate and locate the Desync
  cause.

  There are two levels of Desync recording, which are enabled
  via '-d desync=2' resp. '-d desync=3'. Both will record all
  commands to a file 'commands-out.log' in the autosave folder.

  If you have the savegame from the start of the server, and
  this command log you can replay the whole game. (see Section 3.1)

  If you do not start the server from a savegame, there will
  also be a savegame created just after a map has been generated.
  The savegame will be named 'dmp_cmds_*.sav' and be put into
  the autosave folder.

  In addition to that '-d desync=3' also creates regular savegames
  at defined spots in network time. (more defined than regular
  autosaves). These will be created in the autosave folder
  and will also be named 'dmp_cmds_*.sav'.

  These saves allow comparing the gamestate with the original
  gamestate during replaying, and thus greatly help debugging.
  However, they also take a lot of disk space.


## 3.1) Replaying

  To replay a Desync recording, you need these files:
   - The savegame from when the server was started, resp.
     the automatically created savegame from when the map
     was generated.
   - The 'commands-out.log' file.
   - Optionally the 'dmp_cmds_*.sav'.
  Put these files into a safe spot. (Not your autosave folder!)

  Next, prepare your OpenTTD for replaying:
   - Get the same version of OpenTTD as the original server was running.
   - Uncomment/enable the define 'DEBUG_DUMP_COMMANDS' in
     'src/network/network_func.h'.
     (DEBUG_FAILED_DUMP_COMMANDS is explained later)
   - Put the 'commands-out.log' into the root save folder, and rename
      it to 'commands.log'. Strip everything and including the "newgame"
      entry from the log.
   - Run 'openttd -D -d desync=0 -g startsavegame.sav'.
     This replays the server log. Use "-d desync=3" to also create a
     new 'commands-out.log' and 'dmp_cmds_*.sav' in your autosave folder.

## 3.2) Evaluation of the replay

  The replaying will also compare the checksums which are part of
  the 'commands-out.log' with the replayed gamestate.
  If they differ, it will trigger a 'NOT_REACHED'.

  If the replay succeeds without mismatch, that is the replay reproduces
  the original server state:
   - Repeat the replay starting from incrementally later 'dmp_cmds_*.sav'
     while truncating the 'commands.log' at the beginning appropriately.
     The 'dmp_cmds_*.sav' can be your own ones from the first reply, or
     the ones from the original server (if you have them).
     (This simulates the view of joining clients during the game.)
   - If one of those replays fails, you have located the Desync between
     the last dmp_cmds that reproduces the replay and the first one
     that fails.

  If the replay does not succeed without mismatch, you can check the logs
  whether there were failed commands. Then you may try to replay with
  DEBUG_FAILED_DUMP_COMMANDS enabled. If the replay then fails, the
  command test-run of the failed command modified the game state.

  If you have the original 'dmp_cmds_*.sav', you can also compare those
  savegames with your own ones from the replay. You can also comment/disable
  the 'NOT_REACHED' mentioned above, to get another 'dmp_cmds_*.sav' from
  the replay after the mismatch has already been detected.
  See Section 3.3 on how to compare savegames.
  If the saves differ you have located the Desync between the last dmp_cmds
  that match and the first one that does not. The difference of the saves
  may point you in the direction of what causes it.

  If the replay succeeds without mismatch, and you do not have any
  'dmp_cmd_*.sav' from the original server, it is a lost case.
  Enable creation of the 'dmp_cmd_*.sav' on the server, and wait for the
  next Desync.

  Finally, you can also compare the 'commands-out.log' from the original
  server with the one from the replay. They will differ in stuff like
  dates, and the original log will contain the chat, but otherwise they
  should match.

## 3.3) Comparing savegames

  The binary form of the savegames from the original server and from
  your replay will always differ:
   - The savegame contains paths to used NewGRF files.
   - The gamelog will log your loading of the savegame.
   - The savegame data of AIs and the Gamescript will differ.
     Scripts are not run during the replay, only their recorded commands
     are replayed. Their internal state will thus not change in the
     replay and will differ.

  To compare savegame more semantically, easiest is to first export them
  to a JSON format with for example:

  https://github.com/TrueBrain/OpenTTD-savegame-reader

  By running:

  python -m savegame_reader --export-json dmp_cmds_NNN.sav | jq . > NNN.json

  Now you can use any (JSON) diff tool to compare the two savegames in a
  somewhat human readable way.
# OpenTTD directory structure

OpenTTD uses its own directory to store its required 3rd party base set files
(see section 4.1 'Required 3rd party files') and non-compulsory extension and
configuration files.

See below for their proper place within this OpenTTD main data directory.

The main OpenTTD directories can be found in various locations, depending on
your operating system:

1. The current working directory (from where you started OpenTTD)

    For non-Windows operating systems OpenTTD will not scan for files in this
    directory if it is your personal directory, i.e. '~/', or when it is the
    root directory, i.e. '/'.

2. Your personal directory
    - Windows:
        - `C:\My Documents\OpenTTD` (95, 98, ME)
        - `C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\OpenTTD` (2000, XP)
        - `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenTTD` (7, 8.1, 10, 11)
    - macOS: `~/Documents/OpenTTD`
    - Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/openttd` which is usually `~/.local/share/openttd`
       when built with XDG base directory support, otherwise `~/.openttd`
3. The shared directory
    - Windows:
        - `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents\OpenTTD` (2000, XP)
        - `C:\Users\Public\Documents\OpenTTD` (7, 8.1, 10, 11)
    - macOS: `/Library/Application Support/OpenTTD`
    - Linux: not available
4. The binary directory (where the OpenTTD executable is)
    - Windows: `C:\Program Files\OpenTTD`
    - Linux: `/usr/games`
5. The installation directory (Linux only)
    - Linux: `/usr/share/games/openttd`
6. The application bundle (macOS only)

    It includes the OpenTTD files (grf+lng) and it will work as long as they
    are not touched

Different types of data or extensions go into different subdirectories of the
chosen main OpenTTD directory:

| data type           | directory         | additional info             |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Config File         | (no subdirectory) |                             |
| Screenshots         | screenshot        |                             |
| Base Graphics       | baseset           | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| Sound Sets          | baseset           | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| NewGRFs             | newgrf            | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| 32bpp Sets          | newgrf            | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| Music Sets          | baseset           | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| AIs                 | ai                | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| AI Libraries        | ai/library        | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| Game Scripts (GS)   | game              | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| GS Libraries        | game/library      | (or a subdirectory thereof) |
| Savegames           | save              |                             |
| Automatic Savegames | save/autosave     |                             |
| Scenarios           | scenario          |                             |

The (automatically created) directory content_download is for OpenTTD's internal
use and no files should be added to it or its subdirectories manually.

## Notes:

- Linux in the previous list means .deb, but most paths should be similar for
   others.
- The previous search order is also used for NewGRFs and openttd.cfg.
- If openttd.cfg is not found, then it will be created using the 2, 4, 1, 3,
   5 order. When built with XDG base directory support, openttd.cfg will be
   created in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openttd which is usually ~/.config/openttd.
- Savegames will be relative to the config file only if there is no save/
   directory in paths with higher priority than the config file path, but
   autosaves and screenshots will always be relative to the config file.
   Unless the configuration file is in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openttd, then all
   other files will be saved under $XDG_DATA_HOME/openttd.

## The preferred setup:

Place 3rd party files in shared directory (or in personal directory if you do
not have write access on shared directory) and have your openttd.cfg config
file in personal directory (where the game will then also place savegames and
screenshots).

## Portable installations (portable media)

You can install OpenTTD on external media so you can take it with you, i.e.
using a USB key, or a USB HDD, etc.
Create a directory where you shall store the game in (i.e. OpenTTD/).
Copy the binary (OpenTTD.exe, OpenTTD.app, openttd, etc), baseset/ and your
openttd.cfg to this directory.
You can copy binaries for any operating system into this directory, which will
allow you to play the game on nearly any computer you can attach the external
media to.
As always - additional grf files are stored in the newgrf/ dir (for details,
again, see section 4.1).

## Files in tar (archives)

OpenTTD can read files that are in an uncompressed tar (archive), which
makes it easy to bundle files belonging to the same script, NewGRF or base
set. Music sets are the only exception as they cannot be stored in a tar
file due to being played by external applications.

OpenTTD sees each tar archive as the 'root' of its search path. This means that
having a file with the same path in two different tar files means that one
cannot be opened, after all only one file will be found first. As such it is
advisable to put an uniquely named folder in the root of the tar and put all the
content in that folder. For example, all downloaded content has a path that
concatenates the name of the content and the version, which makes the path
unique. For custom tar files it is advised to do this as well.

The normal files are also referred to by their relative path from the search
directory, this means that also normal files could hide files in a tar as
long as the relative path from the search path of the normal file is the
same as the path in the tar file. Again it is advised to have an unique path
to the normal file so they do not collide with the files from other tar
files.

## Configuration file

The configuration file for OpenTTD (openttd.cfg) is in a simple Windows-like
.INI format. It is mostly undocumented. Almost all settings can be changed
ingame by using the 'Advanced Settings' window.

When you cannot find openttd.cfg you should look in the directories as
described in this document. If you do not have an openttd.cfg OpenTTD will
create one after closing.

# Translations for OpenTTD

Eints is [OpenTTD's WebTranslator](https://translator.openttd.org/).

- Registered translators translate from English to their language.
- Eints validates the translations syntactically and that parameter usage matches the English base language.
- Eints synchronises translations to OpenTTD's repository every day, shortly before the nightly build.

When adding or altering strings in english.txt, you should stick to some rules, so translations are handled smoothly by Eints and translators.
This document gives some guidelines.


## I want to change a translation.

### I want to become a regular translator.

Just [sign up](https://github.com/OpenTTD/team/issues/new/choose) as a translator.

### I only want to point out some issues / typos in the current translation, or suggest a change.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose), so it can be assigned to the translation team of the language.
The translators will decide whether, where and how to apply your suggestion.

### I want to submit translations via PR.

Sorry, we don't offer this option.

Only when there is a consistency problem that needs addressing, this can be done via a PR.
We are very strict about this, and in general all PRs making translation changes will be closed.
But if it is really needed, and the change is not a revert of any older change, a PR can be created to do mass changes to a translation.

### I want to change the language definition (plural form, genders, cases) of a translation.

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose) for this.

### I want to add an entirely new translation language.

OpenTTD has more than 4000 strings, translating all of them is a lot of work.
Despite the initial enthusiasm, only few people have the endurance to get to even 20% translation progress.

As such, starting a new translation requires the prospect that there is also translation interest in the future.
And, frankly, OpenTTD probably already covers all languages to which this applies, and a few more.

If you still want to make the case, that your language is spoken by several 100 million people, please [create an issue](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/new/choose) for adding a new language.


## I want to change the English base language (english.txt).

### I want to change the wording / fix a typo in an English string, without changing the meaning (drastically).

Just change it in your PR.

Translators will be notified that their translation became "outdated", so they can double-check whether the translation needs updating.

### I want to add/change/remove parameters from an English string.

Just change the parameters in english.txt in your PR.
Don't touch the translations, please ignore compile warnings about them.

Translators will be notified that their translation became "invalid", so they can adjust the translation.
Eints will remember the old translations for translators to view, but remove them from the git repository, while they are "invalid"; so there won't be any compile warnings after the nightly sync.

### I want to change the meaning of an English string, so that no existing translation makes any sense anymore.

In this case, please change the STR_xxx string identifier of the string; basically: remove the old string, add a new one.
Don't touch the translations, please ignore compile warnings about them.

Eints will discard all memory of the old strings in the nightly sync, and translators can start fresh with a new string.

### I want to add a new string.

Add the new string somewhere in english.txt, where it fits with the neighbouring strings.
Don't touch the translations, even if you can speak some of the languages.

### I want to remove an unused string.

Remove the string from english.txt.
Don't touch the translations, please ignore compile warnings about them.

Eints will remove the translations from the git repository in the nightly sync.

### I want to reorder strings in english.txt without changing them.

Reorder english.txt as you like. Don't touch the translations.

Eints will reorder all translations to match english.txt in the nightly sync.

### I want to add/change '#' comments.

Change comments in english.txt as you like. Don't touch the translations.

Eints will replicate comments into all translations in the nightly sync. Comments are not translated.

### I want to change the STR_xxx string identifier for code style reasons, without changing the English text.

This is the only case, where your PR should also edit translations.
The STR_xxx string identifier is used by Eints as key value to track strings and translations. If you change it, that's the same as deleting a string and adding an unrelated new one.
So, to keep translations, you have to replace the STR_xxx for all translations in the PR as well.

However, you will only be able to keep the translations which are part of the git repository.
Translation history and information about translations being "outdated" will be lost.
So, keep your code style OCD to a minimum :)


## I want to fight a bot and lose.

Here are some things, people sometimes want to do, but which won't work.

### I want to enforce re-translation by clearing current translations.

You have to change the STR_xxx string identifier, that's the only option.

You cannot "clear" translations by removing them via PR; eints will reinstall the previous "syntactically perfect valid" translation.

### I want to revert a broken change, some translator just did via eints.

You have to revert the translations via the WebTranslator interface.
If there are many changes, ask someone with Admin access to eints, so they can manually upload a fixed translation file to eints.

You cannot revert translations changes via PR. Eints merges translations from git and from web by keeping a translation history, and committing the newest translation to git.
If you revert to an old translation in git, eints will simply think git did not yet get the newer translation, and commit it again.
# Some clarifications about the link graph

`InitializeLinkGraphs` joins all threads, so if the game is abandoned
with some threads still running, they're joined as soon as the next game
(possibly the title game) is started. See also `InitializeGame`.

The MCF (multi-commodity flow) algorithm can be quite CPU-hungry as it's
NP-hard and takes exponential time (though with a very small constant
factor) in the number of nodes.

This is why it is run in a separate thread where possible. However after
some time the thread is joined and if it hasn't finished by then the game
will hang. This problem gets worse if we are running on a platform without
threads. However, as those are usually the ones with less CPU power I
assume the contention for the CPU would make the game hard to play even
with threads or even without cargodist (autosave ...). I might be wrong,
but I won't put any work into this before someone shows me some problem.

You can configure the link graph recalculation time. A link graph
recalculation time of X days means that each link graph job has X days
to run before it is joined. The downside is that the flow stats won't be
updated before the job is finished and thus a high value means less
updates and longer times until changes in capacities are accounted for.
If you play a very large map with a complicated link graph you may want to
raise the time setting to avoid lags. The same holds for systems with slow
CPUs.

Another option to avoid excessive lags is to reduce the accuracy of link
graph calculations. Generally the accuracy is inversely correlated to the
CPU requirements of the MCF algorithm.
# Logging, frame rate and performance metrics

## 1.0) Logging of potentially dangerous actions

OpenTTD is a complex program, and together with NewGRF, it may show a buggy
behaviour. But not only bugs in code can cause problems. There are several
ways to affect game state possibly resulting in program crash or multiplayer
desyncs.

Easier way would be to forbid all these unsafe actions, but that would affect
game usability for many players. We certainly do not want that.
However, we receive bug reports because of this. To reduce time spent with
solving these problems, these potentially unsafe actions are logged in
the savegame (including crash.sav). Log is stored in crash logs, too.

Information logged:

- Adding / removing / changing order of NewGRFs
- Changing NewGRF parameters, loading compatible NewGRF
- Changing game mode (scenario editor <-> normal game)
- Loading game saved in a different OpenTTD / TTDPatch / Transport Tycoon Deluxe /
   original Transport Tycoon version
- Running a modified OpenTTD build
- Changing settings affecting NewGRF behaviour (non-network-safe settings)
- Triggering NewGRF bugs

No personal information is stored.

You can show the game log by typing 'gamelog' in the console or by running
OpenTTD in debug mode.

## 2.0) Frame rate and performance metrics

The Help menu in-game has a function to open the Frame rate window. This
window shows various real-time performance statistics, measuring what parts
of the game require the most processing power currently.

A summary of the statistics can also be retrieved from the console with the
`fps` command. This is especially useful on dedicated servers, where the
administrator might want to determine what's limiting performance in a slow
game.

The frame rate is given as two figures, the simulation rate and the graphics
frame rate. Usually these are identical, as the screen is rendered exactly
once per simulated tick, but in the future there might be support for graphics
and simulation running at different rates. When the game is paused, the
simulation rate drops to zero.

In addition to the simulation rate, a game speed factor is also calculated.
This is based on the target simulation speed, which is 30 milliseconds per
game tick. At that speed, the expected frame rate is 33.33 frames/second, and
the game speed factor is how close to that target the actual rate is. When
the game is in fast forward mode, the game speed factor shows how much
speed up is achieved.

The lower part of the window shows timing statistics for individual parts of
the game. The times shown are short-term and long-term averages of how long
it takes to process one tick of game time, all figures are in milliseconds.

Clicking a line in the lower part of the window opens a graph window, giving
detailed readings on each tick simulated by the game.

The following is an explanation of the different statistics:

- *Game loop* - Total processing time used per simulated "tick" in the game.
  This includes all pathfinding, world updates, and economy handling.
- *Cargo handling* - Time spent loading/unloading cargo at stations, and
  industries and towns sending/retrieving cargo from stations.
- *Train ticks*, *Road vehicle ticks*, *Ship ticks*, *Aircraft ticks* -
  Time spent on pathfinding and other processing for each player vehicle type.
- *World ticks* - Time spent on other world/landscape processing. This
  includes towns growing, building animations, updates of farmland and trees,
  and station rating updates.
- *GS/AI total*, *Game script*, and *AI players* - Time spent running logic
  for game scripts and AI players. The total may show as less than the current
  sum of the individual scripts, this is because AI players at lower
  difficulty settings do not run every game tick, and hence contribute less
  to the average across all ticks. Keep in mind that the "Current" figure is
  also an average, just only over short term.
- *Link graph delay* - Time overruns of the cargo distribution link graph
  update thread. Usually the link graph is updated in a background thread,
  but these updates need to synchronise with the main game loop occasionally,
  if the time spent on link graph updates is longer than the time taken to
  otherwise simulate the game while it was updating, these delays are counted
  in this figure.
- *Graphics rendering* - Total time spent rendering all graphics, including
  both GUI and world viewports. This typically spikes when panning the view
  around, and when more things are happening on screen at once.
- *World viewport rendering* - Isolated time spent rendering just world
  viewports. If this figure is significantly lower than the total graphics
  rendering time, most time is spent rendering GUI than rendering world.
- *Video output* - Speed of copying the rendered graphics to the display
  adapter. Usually this should be very fast (in the range of 0-3 ms), large
  values for this can indicate a graphics driver problem.
- *Sound mixing* - Speed of mixing active audio samples together. Usually
  this should be very fast (in the range of 0-3 ms), if it is slow, consider
  switching to the NoSound set.

If the frame rate window is shaded, the title bar will instead show just the
current simulation rate and the game speed factor.

## 3.0) NewGRF callback profiling

NewGRF developers can profile callback chains via the `newgrf_profile`
console command. The command controls a profiling mode where every sprite
request is measured and logged, and written to a CSV file in the end.

The NewGRF developer tools need to be enabled for the command to function.

View the syntax for the command in-game with the console command
`help newgrf_profile`.

Profiling only works during game or in the editor, it's not possible to
profile across the main menu, world generation, or loading savegames.

The CSV files contain one line per sprite request during the profiling.
They can get very large, especially on large games with many objects from
the GRF. Start profiling short periods such as 3 or 7 days, and watch the
file sizes.

The produced CSV file contains the following fields:

- *Tick* - Game tick counter, this may wrap to zero during recording.
  Mainly useful to distinguish events from separate ticks.
- *Sprite* - Index of the root Action 2 sprite in the GRF file. This is
  the sprite group being resolved.
- *Feature* - NewGRF feature number the sprite group is being resolved for.
  This will be 0xFF for AI purchase selection and ambient sound callbacks.
- *Item* - The id of the item within the GRF. For cargotypes, railtypes,
  roadtypes, and tramtypes, this is the integer representation of the label.
- *CallbackID* - The type of callback being resolved. ID 0 is regular graphics
  lookup. See the `newgrf_callbacks.h` file in the OpenTTD source code for the
  full list of callback IDs.
- *Microseconds* - Total time spent to resolve the Action 2, in microseconds.
- *Depth* - Number of recursive Action 2 lookups were made during resolution.
  Value zero means the sprite group resolved directly.
- *Result* - Result of the callback resolution. For lookups that result in
  a sprite, this is the index of the base action 2 in the GRF file. For
  callbacks that give a numeric result, this is the callback result value.
  For lookups that result in an industry production or tilelayout, this
  is the sprite index of the action 2 defining the production/tilelayout.

## 1.0) Starting a server

- Click on "Multiplayer" in the Start Menu.
- Click on "Start Server".
- Give your server a name.
- Select the visibility of your server:
  - "Public": your server will be publicly listed.
  - "Invite Only": only players who have the invite code for your server can
    join.
  - "Local": only players on your local network can join.
- (optional) Set a password for your server.
- Click "New Game", "Load Game", or "Play Scenario".
- Start playing.

## 2.0) Connecting to a server

- Click on "Multiplayer" in the Start Menu.
- There are three ways to join a server:
  - If you want to connect to a local server, click "Search LAN".
  - If you want to connect to a public game, click "Search internet".
  - If the server-owner shared an invite code with you:
    - Click "Add Server".
    - Fill in the invite code, which always starts with a `+`.
    - Click "OK".
- Click on the server you want to join.
- Click "Join Game".
- If the server has a password, it will ask you for this.
- You see a progressbar how far you are with joining the server.
- Happy playing.

## 2.1) Connecting to a server over the console

- Open the console and type `connect` for help how to connect via the console.

## 3.0) Playing internet games

- Servers with a red dot behind it have a different version then you have. You
  will not be able to join those servers.

- Servers with a yellow dot behind it have NewGRFs that you do not have. You
  will not be able to join those servers. However, via "NewGRF Settings" and
  "Find missing content online" you might be able to download the needed
  NewGRFs after which you can join the server.

- It can happen that a connection is that slow, or you have that many clients
  connected to your server, that your clients start to loose their connection.
  Some things you can do about it:
  - `[network] frame_freq`:
    change it in console with: `set network.frame_freq <number>`
    the number should be between the 0 and 10, not much higher. It indicates
    the delay between clicking and showing up. The higher, the more you notice
    it, but the less bandwidth you use.
    A good value for Internet-games is 2 or 3.

  - `[network] sync_freq`:
    change it in console with: `set network.sync_freq <number>`
    the number should be between the 50 and 1000, not much lower, not much
    higher. It indicates the time between sync-frames. A sync-frame is a frame
    which checks if all clients are still in sync. When the value it too high,
    clients can desync in 1960, but the server detects it in 1970. Not really
    handy. The lower the value, the more bandwidth it uses.

   NB: changing `frame_freq` has more effect on the bandwidth then `sync_freq`.

## 4.0) Tips for servers

- You can launch a dedicated server by adding `-D` as parameter.
- In UNIX like systems, you can fork your dedicated server by adding `-f` as
  parameter.

- You can automatically clean companies that do not have a client connected to
  them, for, let's say, 3 years. You can do this via: `set autoclean_companies`
  and `set autoclean_protected` and `set autoclean_unprotected`. Unprotected
  removes a password from a company when it is not used for more then the
  defined amount of months. `set autoclean_novehicles` can be used to remove
  companies without any vehicles quickly.

- You can also do this manually via the console: `reset_company`.

- You can let your server automatically restart a map when, let's say,
  year 2030 is reached. See `set restart_game_date` for detail.

- If you want to be on the server-list, make your server public. You can do
  this either from the Start Server window, via the in-game Online Players
  window, or by typing in the console: `set server_game_type public`.

- You can protect your server with a password via the console: `set server_pw`,
  or via the Start Server menu.

- When you have many clients connected to your server via Internet, watch your
  bandwidth (if you have any limit on it, set by your ISP). One client uses
  about 1.5 kilobytes per second up and down. To decrease this amount, setting
  `frame_freq` to 1 will reduce it to roughly 1 kilobyte per second per client.

- OpenTTD's default settings for maximum number of clients, and amount of data
  from clients to process are chosen to not influence the normal playing of
  people, but to prevent or at least make it less likely that someone can
  perform a (distributed) denial-of-service attack on your server by causing
  an out-of-memory event by flooding the server with data to send to all
  clients. The major factor in this is the maximum number of clients; with
  32 clients "only" sending one chat message causes 1024 messages to be
  distributed in total, with 64 clients that already quadruples to 4096. Given
  that upstream bandwidth is usually the limiting factor, a queue of packets
  that need to be sent will be created.
  To prevent clients from exploiting this "explosion" of packets to send we
  limit the number of incoming data, resulting in effectively limiting the
  amount of data that OpenTTD will send to the clients. Even with the default
  limits it is possible to generate about 70.000 packets per second, or about
  7 megabit per second of traffic.
  Given that OpenTTD kicks clients after they have not reacted within about 9
  seconds from sending a frame update packet it would be possible that OpenTTD
  keeps about 600.000 packets in memory, using about 50 megabytes of memory.
  Given that OpenTTD allows short bursts of packets, you can have slightly
  more packets in memory in case of a distributed denial of service attack.
  When increasing the amount of incoming data, or the maximum number of
  clients the amount of memory OpenTTD needs in case of a distributed denial
  of service attack is linearly related to the amount of incoming data and
  quadratic to the amount of clients. In short, a rule of thumb for, the
  maximum memory usage for packets is:
  `#max_clients * #max_clients * bytes_per_frame * 10 KiB`.

### 4.1) Imposing landscaping limits

- You can impose limits on companies by the following 4 settings:
  - `terraform_per_64k_frames`
  - `terraform_frame_burst`
  - `clear_per_64k_frames`
  - `clear_frame_burst`

- Explaining `NNN_burst` and `NNN_per_64K_frames`
  - `NNN_burst` defines 3 things, the maximum limit, the limit of a single
    action, and the initial value for the limit assigned to a new company.
    This setting is fairly simple and requires no math.

    A value of 1 means a single tile can be affected by a single action.
    This results in having to click 400 times when wanting to cover an area
    of 20 x 20 tiles.

    The default value 4096 covers an area of 64 x 64 tiles.

  - `NNN_per_64K_frames` defines the number of tiles added to each companies
    limit per frame (however not past the possible maximum value,the
    `NNN_burst`). 64k rather resembles the exact number of 65536 frames. So
    setting this variable to 65536 means: `65536 / 65536 = 1 tile per frame`.

    As a day consists of 74 frames, a company's limit is increased by 74
    tiles during the course of a single day (2.22 seconds).
    To achieve a 1 tile per day increase the following calculation is needed:
    `1 / 74 (frames per day) * 65536 (per_64k_frames) = 885.62...`.
    After rounding: a value of 886 means adding a bit over 1 tile per day.

    There is still enough space to scale this value downwards:
    decreasing this value to 127 results in a bit over 1 tile added to the
    allowance per week (7 days).

    To create a setup in which a company gets an initial allowance only,
    set the value to 0 - no increase of the allowance per frame.

- Even though construction actions include a clear tile action, they are not
  affected by the above settings.

## 5.0) Some useful things

- You can protect your company so nobody else can join uninvited. To do this,
  set a password in your Company window.

- You can chat with other players via ENTER or via SHIFT+T or via the Online
  Players window

- Servers can kick players, so don't make them use it!

## 6.0) Troubleshooting

### My server does not show up in the serverlist

Check if the visibility of your server is set to `public`.

If it is, and your server still isn't showing up, start OpenTTD with
`-d net=4` as extra argument. This will show debug message related to the
network, including communication to/from the Game Coordinator.

See the [Game Coordinator documentation](./game_coordinator.md) for more
technical information about the Game Coordinator service.

### My server warns a lot about getaddrinfo taking N seconds

This could be a transient issue with your (local) DNS server, but if the
problem persists there is likely a configuration issue in DNS resolving on
your computer.

#### Running OpenTTD in a Docker container?

This is an issue with dual-stack Docker containers. If there is no default
IPv6 resolver and IPv6 traffic is preferred, DNS requests will time out after
5 seconds. To resolve this, use an IPv4 DNS server for your Docker container,
for example by adding `--dns 1.1.1.1` to your `docker run` command.
# OpenTTD's Savegame Format

Last updated: 2021-06-15

## Outer container

Savegames for OpenTTD start with an outer container, to contain the compressed data for the rest of the savegame.

`[0..3]` - The first four bytes indicate what compression is used.
In ASCII, these values are possible:

- `OTTD` - Compressed with LZO (deprecated, only really old savegames would use this).
- `OTTN` - No compression.
- `OTTZ` - Compressed with zlib.
- `OTTX` - Compressed with LZMA.

`[4..5]` - The next two bytes indicate which savegame version used.

`[6..7]` - The next two bytes can be ignored, and were only used in really old savegames.

`[8..N]` - Next follows a binary blob which is compressed with the indicated compression algorithm.

The rest of this document talks about this decompressed blob of data.

## Data types

The savegame is written in Big Endian, so when we talk about a 16-bit unsigned integer (`uint16`), we mean it is stored in Big Endian.

The following types are valid:

- `1` - `int8` / `SLE_FILE_I8` -8-bit signed integer
- `2` - `uint8` / `SLE_FILE_U8` - 8-bit unsigned integer
- `3` - `int16` / `SLE_FILE_I16` - 16-bit signed integer
- `4` - `uint16` / `SLE_FILE_U16` - 16-bit unsigned integer
- `5` - `int32` / `SLE_FILE_I32` - 32-bit signed integer
- `6` - `uint32` / `SLE_FILE_U32` - 32-bit unsigned integer
- `7` - `int64` / `SLE_FILE_I64` - 64-bit signed integer
- `8` - `uint64` / `SLE_FILE_U64` - 64-bit unsigned integer
- `9` - `StringID` / `SLE_FILE_STRINGID` - a StringID inside the OpenTTD's string table
- `10` - `str` / `SLE_FILE_STRING` - a string (prefixed with a length-field)
- `11` - `struct` / `SLE_FILE_STRUCT` - a struct

### Gamma value

There is also a field-type called `gamma`.
This is most often used for length-fields, and uses as few bytes as possible to store an integer.
For values <= 127, it uses a single byte.
For values > 127, it uses two bytes and sets the highest bit to high.
For values > 32767, it uses three bytes and sets the two highest bits to high.
And this continues till the value fits.
In a more visual approach:
```
  0xxxxxxx
  10xxxxxx xxxxxxxx
  110xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
  1110xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
  11110--- xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
```

## Chunks

Savegames for OpenTTD store their data in chunks.
Each chunk contains data for a certain part of the game, for example "Companies", "Vehicles", etc.

`[0..3]` - Each chunk starts with four bytes to indicate the tag.
If the tag is `\x00\x00\x00\x00` it means the end of the savegame is reached.
An example of a valid tag is `PLYR` when looking at it via ASCII, which contains the information of all the companies.

`[4..4]` - Next follows a byte where the lower 4 bits contain the type.
The possible valid types are:

- `0` - `CH_RIFF` - This chunk is a binary blob.
- `1` - `CH_ARRAY` - This chunk is a list of items.
- `2` - `CH_SPARSE_ARRAY` - This chunk is a list of items.
- `3` - `CH_TABLE` - This chunk is self-describing list of items.
- `4` - `CH_SPARSE_TABLE` - This chunk is self-describing list of items.

Now per type the format is (slightly) different.

### CH_RIFF

(since savegame version 295, this chunk type is only used for MAP-chunks, containing bit-information about each tile on the map)

A `CH_RIFF` starts with an `uint24` which together with the upper-bits of the type defines the length of the chunk.
In pseudo-code:

```
type = read uint8
if type == 0
    length = read uint24
    length |= ((type >> 4) << 24)
```

The next `length` bytes are part of the chunk.
What those bytes mean depends on the tag of the chunk; further details per chunk can be found in the source-code.

### CH_ARRAY / CH_SPARSE_ARRAY

(this chunk type is deprecated since savegame version 295 and is no longer in use)

`[0..G1]` - A `CH_ARRAY` / `CH_SPARSE_ARRAY` starts with a `gamma`, indicating the size of the next item plus one.
If this size value is zero, it indicates the end of the list.
This indicates the full length of the next item minus one.
In psuedo-code:

```
loop
    size = read gamma - 1
    if size == -1
        break loop
    read <size> bytes
```

`[]` - For `CH_ARRAY` there is an implicit index.
The loop starts at zero, and every iteration adds one to the index.
For entries in the game that were not allocated, the `size` will be zero.

`[G1+1..G2]` - For `CH_SPARSE_ARRAY` there is an explicit index.
The `gamma` following the size indicates the index.

The content of the item is a binary blob, and similar to `CH_RIFF`, it depends on the tag of the chunk what it means.
Please check the source-code for further details.

### CH_TABLE / CH_SPARSE_TABLE

(this chunk type only exists since savegame version 295)

Both `CH_TABLE` and `CH_SPARSE_TABLE` are very similar to `CH_ARRAY` / `CH_SPARSE_ARRAY` respectively.
The only change is that the chunk starts with a header.
This header describes the chunk in details; with the header you know the meaning of each byte in the binary blob that follows.

`[0..G]` - The header starts with a `gamma` to indicate the size of all the headers in this chunk plus one.
If this size value is zero, it means there is no header, which should never be the case.

Next follows a list of `(type, key)` pairs:

- `[0..0]` - Type of the field.
- `[1..G]` - `gamma` to indicate length of key.
- `[G+1..N]` - Key (in UTF-8) of the field.

If at any point `type` is zero, the list stops (and no `key` follows).

The `type`'s lower 4 bits indicate the data-type (see chapter above).
The `type`'s 5th bit (so `0x10`) indicates if the field is a list, and if this field in every record starts with a `gamma` to indicate how many times the `type` is repeated.

If the `type` indicates either a `struct` or `str`, the `0x10` flag is also always set.

As the savegame format allows (list of) structs in structs, if any `struct` type is found, this header will be followed by a header of that struct.
This nesting of structs is stored depth-first, so given this table:

```
type   | key
-----------------
uint8  | counter
struct | substruct1
struct | substruct2
```

With `substruct1` being like:

```
type   | key
-----------------
uint8  | counter
struct | substruct3
```

The headers will be, in order: `table`, `substruct1`, `substruct3`, `substruct2`, each ending with a `type` is zero field.

After reading all the fields of all the headers, there is a list of records.
To read this, see `CH_ARRAY` / `CH_SPARSE_ARRAY` for details.

As each `type` has a well defined length, you can read the records even without knowing anything about the chunk-tag yourself.

Do remember, that if the `type` had the `0x10` flag active, the field in the record first has a `gamma` to indicate how many times that `type` is repeated.

#### Guidelines for network-compatible patch-packs

For network-compatible patch-packs (client-side patches that can play together with unpatched clients) we advise to prefix the field-name with `__<shortname>` when introducing new fields to an existing chunk.

Example: you have an extra setting called `auto_destroy_rivers` you want to store in the savegame for your patched client called `mypp`.
We advise you to call this setting `__mypp_auto_destroy_rivers` in the settings chunk.

Doing it this way ensures that a savegame created by these patch-packs can still safely be loaded by unpatched clients.
They will simply ignore the field and continue loading the savegame as usual.
The prefix is strongly advised to avoid conflicts with future-settings in an unpatched client or conflicts with other patch-packs.

## Scripts custom data format

Script chunks (`AIPL` and `GSDT`) use `CH_TABLE` chunk type.

At the end of each record there's an `uint8` to indicate if there's custom data (1) or not (0).

There are 6 data types for scripts, called `script-data-type`.
When saving, each `script-data-type` starts with the type marker saved as `uint8` followed by the actual data.
- `0` - `SQSL_INT`:
  - an `int64` with the actual value (`int32` before savegame version 296).
- `1` - `SQSL_STRING`:
  - an `uint8` with the string length.
  - a list of `int8` for the string itself.
- `2` - `SQSL_ARRAY`:
  - each element saved as `script-data-type`.
  - an `SQSL_ARRAY_TABLE_END` (0xFF) marker (`uint8`).
- `3` - `SQSL_TABLE`:
  - for each element:
    - key saved as `script-data-type`.
    - value saved as `script-data-type`.
  - an `SQSL_ARRAY_TABLE_END` (0xFF) marker (`uint8`).
- `4` - `SQSL_BOOL`:
  - an `uint8` with 0 (false) or 1 (true).
- `5` - `SQSL_NULL`:
  - (no data follows)

The first data type is always a `SQSL_TABLE`.
# OpenTTD's Symbol Server

For all official releases, OpenTTD collects the Breakpad Symbols (SYM-files) and Microsoft's Symbols (PDB-files), and publishes them on our own Symbol Server (https://symbols.openttd.org).

These symbol files are needed to analyze `crash.dmp` files as attached to issues by users.
A `crash.dmp` is created on Windows, Linux, and MacOS when a crash happens.
This combined with the `crash.log` should give a pretty good indication what was going on at the moment the game crashed.

## Analyzing a crash.dmp

### MSVC

In MSVC you can add the above URL as Symbol Server (and please enable MSVC's for all other libraries), allowing you to analyze `crash.dmp`.

Now simply open up the `crash.dmp`, and start debugging.

### All other platforms

The best tool to use is `minidump-stackwalk` as published in the Rust's cargo index:

```bash
cargo install --locked minidump-stackwalk
```

For how to install Rust, please see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Now run the tool like:

```bash
minidump-stackwalk <crash.dmp> --symbols-url https://symbols.openttd.org
```

For convenience, the above Symbol Server also check with Mozilla's Symbol Server in case any other library but OpenTTD is requested.
This means files like `libc`, `kernel32.dll`, etc are all available on the above mentioned Symbol Server.

        If you have no AIs and an AI is started the so-called 'dummy' AI will
        be loaded. This AI does nothing but writing a message on the AI debug
        window and showing a red warning. There are basically two solutions
        for this problem: Either you set the number of AI players to 0 so that
        no AI is started. You find that setting at the top of the window in the
        "AI / Game Scripts Settings" window.
        The other solution is acquiring (downloading) some AI. The easiest way
        to do this is via the "Check Online Content" button in the main (intro)
        menu or directly in the "AI / Game Scripts Settings" dialogue via the
        "Check Online Content" button.

After a while of playing, colours get corrupted:
        In Windows 7 the background slideshow corrupts the colour mapping
        of OpenTTD's 8bpp screen modes. Workarounds for this are:
                a) Switching to windowed mode, instead of fullscreen
                b) Switching off background slideshow
                c) Setting up the 32bpp-anim or 32bpp-optimized blitter

Custom vehicle type name is incorrectly aligned:
        Some NewGRFs use sprites that are bigger than normal in the "buy
        vehicle" window. Due to this they have to encode an offset for
        the vehicle type name. Upon renaming the vehicle type this encoded
        offset is stripped from the name because the "edit box" cannot show
        this encoding. As a result the custom vehicle type names will get
        the default alignment. The only way to (partially) fix this is by
        adding spaces to the custom name.

Clipping problems [#119]:
        In some cases sprites are not drawn as one would expect. Examples of
        this are aircraft that might be hidden below the runway or trees that
        in some cases are rendered over vehicles.
        The primary cause of this problem is that OpenTTD does not have enough
        data (like a 3D model) to properly determine what needs to be drawn in
        front of what. OpenTTD has bounding boxes but in lots of cases they
        are either too big or too small and then cause problems with what
        needs to be drawn in front of what. Also some visual tricks are used.
        For example trains at 8 pixels high, the catenary needs to be drawn
        above that. When you want to draw bridges on top of that, which are
        only one height level (= 8 pixels) higher, you are getting into some
        big problems.
        We can not change the height levels; it would require us to either
        redraw all vehicle or all landscape graphics. Doing so would mean we
        leave the Transport Tycoon graphics, which in effect means OpenTTD
        will not be a Transport Tycoon clone anymore.

Mouse scrolling not possible at the edges of the screen [#383] [#3966]:
        Scrolling the viewport with the mouse cursor at the edges of the screen
        in the same direction of the edge will fail. If the cursor is near the
        edge the scrolling will be very slow.
        OpenTTD only receives cursor position updates when the cursor is inside
        OpenTTD's window. It is not told how far you have moved the cursor
        outside of OpenTTD's window.

Lost trains ignore (block) exit signals [#1473]:
        If trains are lost they ignore block exit signals, blocking junctions
        with presignals. This is caused because the path finders cannot tell
        where the train needs to go. As such a random direction is chosen at
        each junction. This causes the trains to occasionally to make choices
        that are unwanted from a player's point of view.
        This will not be fixed because lost trains are in almost all cases a
        network problem, e.g. a train can never reach a specific place. This
        makes the impact of fixing the bug enormously small against the amount
        of work needed to write a system that prevents the lost trains from
        taking the wrong direction.

Vehicle owner of last transfer leg gets paid for all [#2427]:
        When you make a transfer system that switches vehicle owners. This
        is only possible with 'industry stations', e.g. the oil rig station
        the owner of the vehicle that does the final delivery gets paid for
        the whole trip. It is not shared amongst the different vehicle
        owners that have participated in transporting the cargo.
        This sharing is not done because it would enormously increase the
        memory and CPU usage in big games for something that is happening
        in only one corner case. We think it is not worth the effort until
        sharing of stations is an official feature.

Forbid 90 degree turns does not work for crossing PBS paths [#2737]:
        When you run a train through itself on a X junction with PBS turned on
        the train will not obey the 'forbid 90 degree turns' setting. This is
        due to the fact that we can not be sure that the setting was turned
        off when the track was reserved, which means that we assume it was
        turned on and that the setting does not hold at the time. We made it
        this way to allow one to change the setting in-game, but it breaks
        slightly when you are running your train through itself. Running a
        train through means that your network is broken and is thus a user
        error which OpenTTD tries to graciously handle.
        Fixing this bug means that we need to record whether this particular
        setting was turned on or off at the time the reservation was made. This
        means adding quite a bit of data to the savegame for solving an issue
        that is basically an user error. We think it is not worth the effort.

Duplicate (station) names after renaming [#3204]:
        After renaming stations one can create duplicate station names. This
        is done giving a station the same custom name as another station with
        an automatically generated name.
        The major part of this problem is that station names are translatable.
        Meaning that a station is called e.g. '<TOWN> Central' in English and
        '<TOWN> Centraal' in Dutch. This means that in network games the
        renaming of a town could cause the rename to succeed on some clients
        and fail at others. This creates an inconsistent game state that will
        be seen as a 'desync'. Secondly the custom names are intended to fall
        completely outside of the '<TOWN> <name>' naming of stations, so when
        you rename a town all station names are updated accordingly.
        As a result the decision has been made that all custom names are only
        compared to the other custom names in the same class and not compared
        to the automatically generated names.

Extreme CPU usage/hangs when using SDL and PulseAudio [#3294],
OpenTTD hangs/freezes when closing, OpenTTD is slow, OpenTTD uses a lot of CPU:
        OpenTTD can be extremely slow/use a lot of CPU when the sound is
        played via SDL and then through PulseAudio's ALSA wrapper. Under the
        same configuration OpenTTD, or rather SDL, might hang when exiting
        the game. This problem is seen most in Ubuntu 9.04 and higher.

        This is because recent versions of the PulseAudio sound server
        are configured to use timer-based audio scheduling rather than
        interrupt-based audio scheduling. Configuring PulseAudio to force
        use of interrupt-based scheduling may resolve sound problems for
        some users. Under recent versions of Ubuntu Linux (9.04 and higher)
        this can be accomplished by changing the following line in the
        /etc/pulse/default.pa file:
                load-module module-udev-detect
        to
                load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0
        Note that PulseAudio must be restarted for changes to take effect. Older
        versions of PulseAudio may use the module-hal-detect module instead.
        Adding tsched=0 to the end of that line will have a similar effect.

        Another possible solution is selecting the "pulse" backend of SDL
        by either using "SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse openttd" at the command
        prompt or installing the 'libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio' package from
        Ubuntu's Universe repository. For other distributions a similar
        package needs to be installed.

OpenTTD not properly resizing with SDL on X [#3305]:
        Under some X window managers OpenTTD's window does not properly
        resize. You will either end up with a black bar at the right/bottom
        side of the window or you cannot see the right/bottom of the window,
        e.g. you cannot see the status bar. The problem is that OpenTTD does
        not always receive a resize event from SDL making it impossible for
        OpenTTD to know that the window was resized; sometimes moving the
        window will solve the problem.
        Window managers that are known to exhibit this behaviour are GNOME's
        and KDE's. With the XFCE's and LXDE's window managers the resize
        event is sent when the user releases the mouse.

Incorrect colours, crashes upon exit, debug warnings and smears upon
window resizing with SDL on macOS [#3447]:
        Video handling with (lib)SDL under macOS is known to fail on some
        versions of macOS with some hardware configurations. Some of
        the problems happen only under some circumstances whereas others
        are always present.
        We suggest that the SDL video/sound backend is not used for OpenTTD
        in combinations with macOS.

Train crashes entering same junction from block and path signals [#3928]:
        When a train has reserved a path from a path signal to a two way
        block signal and the reservation passes a path signal through the
        back another train can enter the reserved path (only) via that
        same two way block signal.
        The reason for this has to do with optimisation; to fix this issue
        the signal update has to pass all path signals until it finds either
        a train or a backwards facing signal. This is a very expensive task.
        The (signal) setups that allow these crashes can furthermore be
        considered incorrectly signalled; one extra safe waiting point for
        the train entering from path signal just after the backwards facing
        signal (from the path signal train) resolves the issue.

Crashes when run in a VM using Parallels Desktop [#4003]:
        When the Windows version of OpenTTD is executed in a VM under
        Parallels Desktop a privileged instruction exception may be thrown.
        As OpenTTD works natively on macOS as well as natively on Windows and
        these native builds both don't exhibit this behaviour this crash is
        most likely due to a bug in the virtual machine, something out of
        the scope of OpenTTD. Most likely this is due to Parallels Desktop
        lacking support for RDTSC calls. The problem can be avoided by using
        other VM-software, Wine, or running natively on macOS.

Entry- and exit signals are not dragged [#4378]:
        Unlike all other signal types, the entry- and exit signals are not
        dragged but instead normal signals are placed on subsequent track
        sections. This is done on purpose as this is the usually more
        convenient solution. There are little to no occasions where more
        than one entry or exit signal in a row are useful. This is different
        for all other signal types where several in a row can serve one
        purpose or another.

Station build date is incorrect [#4415]:
        The tile query tool will show the date of the last (re)construction
        at the station and not the date of the first construction. This is
        due to compatibility reasons with NewGRFs and the fact that it is
        wrong to say that the station is built in a particular year when it
        was completely destroyed/rebuilt later on.
        The tile query tool can be fixed by changing the "Build date" text
        to "Date at which the last (re)construction took place" but this is
        deemed too specific and long for that window.

(Temporary) wrong colours when switching to full screen [#4511]:
        On Windows it can happen that you temporarily see wrong colours
        when switching to full screen OpenTTD, either by starting
        OpenTTD in full screen mode, changing to full screen mode or by
        ALT-TAB-ing into a full screen OpenTTD. This is caused by the
        fact that OpenTTD, by default, uses 8bpp paletted output. The
        wrong colours you are seeing is a temporary effect of the video
        driver switching to 8bpp palette mode.

        This issue can be worked around in two ways:
                a) Setting fullscreen_bpp to 32
                b) Setting up the 32bpp-anim or 32bpp-optimized blitter

Can't run OpenTTD with the -d option from a MSYS console [#4587]:
        The MSYS console does not allow OpenTTD to open an extra console for
        debugging output. Compiling OpenTTD with the --enable-console
        configure option prevents this issue and allows the -d option to use
        the MSYS console for its output.

Unreadable characters for non-latin locales [#4607]:
        OpenTTD does not ship a non-latin font in its graphics files. As a
        result OpenTTD needs to acquire the font from somewhere else. What
        OpenTTD does is ask the operating system, or a system library, for
        the best font for a given language if the currently loaded font
        does not provide all characters of the chosen translation. This
        means that OpenTTD has no influence over the quality of the chosen
        font; it just does the best it can do.

        If the text is unreadable there are several steps that you can take
        to improve this. The first step is finding a good font and configure
        this in the configuration file. See section 9.0 of README.md for
        more information. You can also increase the font size to make the
        characters bigger and possible better readable.

        If the problem is with the clarity of the font you might want to
        enable anti-aliasing by setting the small_aa/medium_aa/large_aa
        settings to "true". However, anti-aliasing only works when a 32-bit
        blitter has been selected, e.g. blitter = "32bpp-anim", as with the
        8 bits blitter there are not enough colours to properly perform the
        anti-aliasing.

Train does not crash with itself [#4635]:
        When a train drives in a circle the front engine passes through
        wagons of the same train without crashing. This is intentional.
        Signals are only aware of tracks, they do not consider the train
        length and whether there would be enough room for a train in some
        circle it might drive on. Also the path a train might take is not
        necessarily known when passing a signal.
        Checking all circumstances would take a lot of additional
        computational power for signals, which is not considered worth
        the effort, as it does not add anything to gameplay.
        Nevertheless trains shall not crash in normal operation, so making
        a train not crash with itself is the best solution for everyone.

Aircraft coming through wall in rotated airports [#4705]:
        With rotated airports, specifically hangars, you will see that the
        aircraft will show a part through the back wall of the hangar.
        This can be solved by only drawing a part of the plane when being
        at the back of the hangar, however then with transparency turned on
        the aircraft would be shown partially which would be even weirder.
        As such the current behaviour is deemed the least bad.
        The same applies to overly long ships and their depots.

Vehicles not keeping their "maximum" speed [#4815]:
        Vehicles that have not enough power to reach and maintain their
        advertised maximum speed might be constantly jumping between two
        speeds. This is due to the fact that speed and its calculations
        are done with integral numbers instead of floating point numbers.
        As a result of this a vehicle will never reach its equilibrium
        between the drag/friction and propulsion. So in effect it will be
        in a vicious circle of speeding up and slowing down due to being
        just at the other side of the equilibrium.

        Not speeding up when near the equilibrium will cause the vehicle to
        never come in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium and not slowing
        down when near the equilibrium will cause the vehicle to never slow
        down towards the equilibrium once it has come down a hill.

        It is possible to calculate whether the equilibrium will be passed,
        but then all acceleration calculations need to be done twice.

Settings not saved when OpenTTD crashes [#4846]:
        The settings are not saved when OpenTTD crashes for several reasons.
        The most important is that the game state is broken and as such the
        settings might contain invalid values, or the settings have not even
        been loaded yet. This would cause invalid or totally wrong settings
        to be written to the configuration file.

        A solution to that would be saving the settings whenever one changes,
        however due to the way the configuration file is saved this requires
        a flush of the file to the disk and OpenTTD needs to wait till that
        is finished. On some file system implementations this causes the
        flush of all 'write-dirty' caches, which can be a significant amount
        of data to be written. This can further be aggravated by spinning
        down disks to conserve power, in which case this disk needs to be
        spun up first. This means that many seconds may pass before the
        configuration file is actually written, and all that time OpenTTD
        will not be able to show any progress. Changing the way the
        configuration file is saved is not an option as that leaves us more
        vulnerable to corrupt configuration files.

        Finally, crashes should not be happening. If they happen they should
        be reported and fixed, so essentially fixing this is fixing the wrong
        thing. If you really need the configuration changes to be saved,
        and you need to run a version that crashes regularly, then you can
        use the 'saveconfig' command in the console to save the settings.

Not all NewGRFs, AIs, game scripts are found [#4887]:
        Under certain situations, where the path for the content within a
        tar file is the same as other content on the file system or in another
        tar file, it is possible that content is not found. A more thorough
        explanation and solutions are described in section 4.4 of README.md.

Mouse cursor going missing with SDL [#4997]:
        Under certain circumstances SDL does not notify OpenTTD of changes with
        respect to the mouse pointer, specifically whether the mouse pointer
        is within the bounds of OpenTTD or not. For example, if you "Alt-Tab"
        to another application the mouse cursor will still be shown in OpenTTD,
        and when you move the mouse outside of the OpenTTD window so the cursor
        gets hidden, open/move another application on top of the OpenTTD window
        and then Alt-tab back into OpenTTD the cursor will not be shown.

        We cannot fix this problem as SDL simply does not provide the required
        information in these corner cases. This is a bug in SDL and as such
        there is little that we can do about it.

Trains might not stop at platforms that are currently being changed [#5553]:
        If you add tiles to or remove tiles from a platform while a train is
        approaching to stop at the same platform, that train can miss the place
        where it's supposed to stop and pass the station without stopping.
        This is caused by the fact that the train is considered to already
        have stopped if it's beyond its assigned stopping location. We can't
        let the train stop just anywhere in the station because then it would
        never leave the station if you have the same station in the order
        list multiple times in a row or if there is only one station
        in theorder list (see #5684).

Some houses and industries are not affected by transparency [#5817]:
        Some of the default houses and industries (f.e. the iron ore mine) are
        not affected by the transparency options. This is because the graphics
        do not (completely) separate the ground from the building.
        This is a bug of the original graphics, and unfortunately cannot be
        fixed with OpenGFX for the sake of maintaining compatibility with
        the original graphics.

Involuntary cargo exchange with cargodist via neutral station [#6114]:
        When two players serve a neutral station at an industry, a cross-company
        chain for cargo flow can and will be established which can only be
        interrupted if one of the players stops competing for the resources of
        that industry. There is an easy fix for this: If you are loading at the
        shared station make the order "no unload" and if you're unloading make
        it "no load". Cargodist will then figure out that it should not create
        such a route.

Incorrect ending year displayed in end of game newspaper [#8625]
        The ending year of the game is configurable, but the date displayed in
        the newspaper at the end of the game is part of the graphics, not text.
        So to fix this would involve fixing the graphics in every baseset,
        including the original. Additionally, basesets are free to put this
        text in different positions (which they do), making a proper solution
        to this infinitely more complex for a part of the game that fewer than
        1% of players ever see.

Calendar-based is the classic OpenTTD experience, with a year consisting of 12 months, and each month having 28-31 days.

In Wallclock-based time, cargo production and financials are instead based on one-minute increments, which is about as long as a 30 day month takes in Calendar-based mode. These are grouped into 12-minute periods, equivalent to a year in Calendar-based mode.

In either mode there is always a classic calendar, which is used for introduction dates of vehicles, houses, and other infrastructureCalendar	WallclockMinutes per year: Choose the number of minutes in a calendar year.

Each recalculation calculates the plans for one component of the graph. That means that a value X for this setting does not mean the whole graph will be updated every X seconds. Only some component will. The shorter you set it the more CPU time will be necessary to calculate it. The longer you set it the longer it will take until the cargo distribution starts on new routes0Take  for recalculation of distribution graphTime taken for each recalculation of a link graph component. When a recalculation is started, a thread is spawned which is allowed to run for this number of seconds. The shorter you set this the more likely it is that the thread is not finished when it's supposed to. Then the game stops until it is ("lag"). The longer you set it the longer it takes for the distribution to be updated when routes change%Distribution mode for passengers: "Symmetric" means that roughly the same number of passengers will go from a station A to a station B as from B to A. "Asymmetric" means that arbitrary numbers of passengers can go in either direction. "Manual" means that no automatic distribution will take place for passengersDistribution mode for mail: "Symmetric" means that roughly the same amount of mail will be sent from a station A to a station B as from B to A. "Asymmetric" means that arbitrary amounts of mail can be sent in either direction. "Manual" means that no automatic distribution will take place for mail3Distribution mode for the ARMOURED cargo class: ¡The ARMOURED cargo class contains valuables in the temperate, diamonds in the subtropical, or gold in the subarctic climate. NewGRFs may change that. "Symmetric" means that roughly the same amount of that cargo will be sent from a station A to a station B as from B to A. "Asymmetric" means that arbitrary amounts of that cargo can be sent in either direction. "Manual" means that no automatic distribution will take place for that cargo. It is recommended to set this to asymmetric or manual when playing subarctic or subtropic, as banks only receive cargo in these climates. For temperate you can also choose symmetric as banks will send valuables back to the origin bank.Distribution mode for other cargo classes: "Asymmetric" means that arbitrary amounts of cargo can be sent in either direction. "Manual" means that no automatic distribution will take place for those cargoesmanual
asymmetric	symmetricDistribution accuracy: The higher you set this the more CPU time the calculation of the link graph will take. If it takes too long you may notice lag. If you set it to a low value, however, the distribution will be inaccurate, and you may notice cargo not being sent to the places you expect it to go"Effect of distance on demands: nIf you set this to a value higher than 0, the distance between the origin station A of some cargo and a possible destination B will have an effect on the amount of cargo sent from A to B. The further away B is from A the less cargo will be sent. The higher you set it, the less cargo will be sent to far away stations and the more cargo will be sent to near stations1Amount of returning cargo for symmetric mode: Setting this to less than 100% makes the symmetric distribution behave more like the asymmetric one. Less cargo will be forcibly sent back if a certain amount is sent to a station. If you set it to 0% the symmetric distribution behaves just like the asymmetric one?Saturation of short paths before using high-capacity paths: ¾Frequently there are multiple paths between two given stations. Cargodist will saturate the shortest path first, then use the second shortest path until that is saturated and so on. Saturation is determined by an estimation of capacity and planned usage. Once it has saturated all paths, if there is still demand left, it will overload all paths, prefering the ones with high capacity. Most of the time the algorithm will not estimate the capacity accurately, though. This setting allows you to specify up to which percentage a shorter path must be saturated in the first pass before choosing the next longer one. Set it to less than 100% to avoid overcrowded stations in case of overestimated capacitySpeed units (land): Speed units (nautical): NWhenever a speed is shown in the user interface, show it in the selected unitsImperial (mph)Metric (km/h)SI (m/s)Game units (tiles/day)Game units (tiles/sec)KnotsVehicle power units: XWhenever a vehicle's power is shown in the user interface, show it in the selected unitsImperial (hp)Metric (hp)SI (kW)Weights units: OWhenever a weight is shown in the user interface, show it in the selected unitsImperial (short t/ton)Metric (t/tonne)SI (kg)Volumes units: OWhenever a volume is shown in the user interface, show it in the selected unitsImperial (gal)
